        "transcript_text": "Awesome. Thanks all for joining today's. All remote group conversation. We appreciate you taking time to join. The slides are in the agenda doc as well as the what's happening channel. So we will dive into questions. Looks like Jamie Rachel has the first one and currently the only one. So if anybody is joining, you want to ask a question, feel free to document under that or verbalize and we can document after the fact. Jamie, are you here? I don't see her. No worries. I'll verbalize jamie's question. So, Jamie said, as a newbie to GitLab, as a new labor, do you have any tips on how to unlearn corporate norms and how to adapt to the GitLab all remote culture? I love this question. First off, welcome to GitLab. Thank you so much for joining the team. So I'll start with this. Looking for ways to implement our subvalues is where I would start. Our subvalues are fascinating. Our values are words you've probably heard before, things like collaboration, iteration, results. But the truth is those words can mean different things to different people. And what is very special about GitLab is we have subvalues, which act as substantiators that really spell out in granular detail what we mean by iteration and collaboration. So there's very little guesswork. We do all of that work for you, and it's grown over the time that I've been here. Look at those subvalues. Some of them are incredibly profound. Short toes, no ego blameless, problem solving. Everything is in draft. Those give you actionable ways to go about your day to day and how you approach your work. I really love short toes. No one can step on anyone's toes because we all have short toes. That creates a psychologically safe atmosphere where everyone can contribute. So I would say dig into the values. I reference them every single day in every work decision that I make. And a lot of the values specifically tell you how to unlearn some of the corporate norms. Short toes is a great one. I'm sure you've been in a corporate environment where you'll hear someone say, swim in your own lane or this isn't your department. Make sure you stay over there. Short toes goes exactly counter to that, and that is exactly what we hope to achieve. I'll also say check out public slack channels, issues and epics. Watch people work. I was fascinated when I joined the company that I could just peek my head into any other department and see how they were working. And I would say pay close attention to the thanks channel and what values are lived out in discretionary bonuses. So our team member updates channel, you'll see discretionary bonuses being handed out every single week. Pay attention to what values people were nominated for. It usually gives you some indication of how a value was lived out. And I found it pretty easy to reverse engineer when I saw other people living out those values. So once you get on that, you'll become the reverse engineer for people who will join after you. I'd also say develop a reflexive instinct to old ways. So if you catch yourself, defaulting to a meeting or any other old corporate norm, that should act as a trigger to question it and reference the handbook or ask someone else, is there a different way or an elevated way to approach this? And the last thing that I'll mention here is be the change you want to see. So, for example, it's a little awkward when I remind people in a slack channel to not use at here or at channel or to continue conversations in a thread instead of just right under each other. But this is in our handbook, these are our communication guidelines, and they're there so that it's easier to communicate and there's an understood way to do it. And really, it's the only way people learn. And I see that Jessica is adding a point here as well. Jessica on the All Remote team, so I'll hand it over to her for other tips. Yeah, as I was listening, I was also just thinking, it's good to give it you. This is a strong culture here, and a lot of us came from strong cultures, and it does take time to sort of shift your ways of working, ways of thinking. But what is wonderful about this particular team is that people will actively guide you, so you don't have to fit in right away or change yourself more. Give yourself the time and space to observe, to learn, to challenge yourself and trust that your team members will help you and support you and guide you. I think that's a very important part of the culture here that has been extremely helpful for me. So, yeah, give yourself the time and let it sink in. Awesome. Hear to that. Looks like Christy has the second question. I do. As more companies go remote, I'm seeing more products that offer employee monitoring. Just this morning, I got an email from a vendor wanting me to talk to them about monitoring GitLab's employees, which obviously I didn't even open. I've also heard companies talk about how uncomfortable it is not to know what their employees are doing. So I've talked to them about you got to trust people and look at results, but this seems like a really big problem. I see why this idea might be appealing to companies that are not used to working in this way. At the same time, it's toxic, and I feel like we are really well positioned to help shape a story around why this is not a good idea. So I'm curious, what are we doing on this front? Yeah, love that. Well articulated. We are in the beginnings of creating the de facto remote playbook. So for those who have been here for a year, we did a remote playbook last year. It was an MVC, a quick iteration, bundling up all of the all remote guides that we had and essentially laying it out as one key PDF asset that essentially collected all of GitLab's proven principles on how to work remotely. But this year we have this massive opportunity not to just write GitLab's remote playbook, but the remote playbook by GitLab. And there's a big difference between the two. We have earned the authority in the space to show the world how to do this, and to some degree, we feel a responsibility to do that. So what are we doing right now? I'm in panels, interviews, webinars, talking with academics, building case studies with some of the top universities in the world every single day. And this question comes up a lot. And what I am doing is pulling out pieces of the handbook and showing how GitLab focuses on results. It's not about the time that you spend, it's all about the results. And for me, I try to boil it down to a boring solution. I'll ask a manager, how did you know someone was working in the office if you were just looking at them and assuming they were working? That wasn't a good approach to begin with. So really, the manager and the Direct need to both be able to have clarity on what does success look like. It's really as simple as that. And so the message that I'm giving leaders who are transitioning is ask your team that question what does success look like? And if both sides can't answer that, then you have to go back to the drawing board and actually figure out what metrics you want to measure. But the real shake up here is once those metrics are defined, a lot of organizations are not so comfortable letting their direct report say, here are the tools, technologies and communication workflows I need to achieve that goal. It removes a lot of the subjectivity, and this is a bit of an uncomfortable conversation where the power is shifting more towards the people it's democratizing. In many ways, I think it's a great thing, but I do see companies struggling with it who have gotten to where they are through this kind of command and control type of atmosphere. Managers in a remote setting are less directors and more unblockers. You just have to be open to feedback and let your people come to you and tell you what they need you to unblock for them. And if they're coming to you and you create a psychologically safe atmosphere where they can tell you what they need unblocked and then you as a manager will unblock them and let them run really fast. That's the ideal utopian state. But a lot of companies have a long way to go to get there, and especially if their default is to think about monitoring, there's a lot of mental shifting that has to take place. And I think we will take advantage of the platform that we have to reinforce just how important trust is. Jessica, do you have anything to add on that? Oh, Christy, go ahead. If you wanted to add context. Yeah, I would love to see because GitLab is being featured in national articles all the time in the context of remote. I would love to see us have an article or something where we really talk about this, because I've seen articles talking about the shift towards this, but I haven't seen anybody come out and really say, like, hey, this is a bad idea. Here's why. Here's all the things you just talked about, here's how you can do it differently. And I think that could have a really meaningful impact on work culture. I will say I think there is a slide in the deck. Last June, we were interviewed by CMDC along with maybe ten other people. And the context of that interview was they wanted to get the full spectrum of where people landed on employee monitoring or not. So there are some people on that video that actually sold the employee monitoring services and they gave all the reasons why and then they talked to me. So I do have a moment in that video where it's like the GitLab approach seems vastly different to that. And at last count, that CNBC Video had over 700,000 views on YouTube. So that's a great start, and we can link that here in the agenda, but I totally agree with that. And this is something that I'll take to our external comms team and I think we can run with it. Zach, I see you're typing there. Did you want to add anything on this question before we jump to the next? Yeah, sure. I think one of the things that we do really well is talking about the difficult and the hard things about working remote and not just the positive. And I think in terms of where this question originated, I think you can also advocate that people may actually work longer or harder being remote. Whether that's the fact that you have more opportunity, you're home, maybe you're working a twelve hour day, seven to seven, and doing things in the middle of your day. But because of that flexibility and opportunity that's provided through remote work, it's not always encouraging less work. It's a great question. I mean, a great point. Yeah, I've gotten to bring that up. The point that I've made is we have the opposite problem of what companies think they're going to have in which we are actively encouraging people not to overwork, because that is more of the tendency when people go remote. And then that's our responsibility to them as leaders to say, hey, look, I see how productive you are. That's awesome. You have to take care of yourself. Yeah, for sure. And we have a handbook page on the nonlinear workday. Zach and I have to continually remind myself that this is somewhat of a understood principle here, but for many people, it is a completely foreign concept that you could just disappear for hours in a day and rearrange your day and still be productive. For many people, the default of that is that is the definition of slacking off instead of the definition of ultimate productivity and flexibility. So it's always a good reminder that we have to meet people where they are and explain some of these concepts that we are fortunate, to some degree, take for granted and we've internalized in a lot of ways. Jessica, you had the next point. Yeah, I'm going to jump in and just say, we released a report this week, actually, where we started talking to people who are working remotely around the world and asking them what they're doing, how they're designing their work life. And a lot of people came back with this question of, like, I'm working too hard. I don't know how to set boundaries between my work and life. I think what we've noticed between from last year to this year is that where last year the conversation about remote work was, can people do it? Can they be productive? Now the conversation is becoming, are we burning ourselves out? And I think that that is something we can really, really dig into because it is affecting everyone. It's global, and now we've all seen it firsthand. So I think that's where this fits in. Employers need to start thinking about how to give their team members more space, because ultimately, yeah, we do work harder when we're working remotely. And it's really not a question of whether people are working at all. It's a question of whether they are happy and whether they're able to sustain it over a long period of time without burning out. And Christy, I actually just looked back through my slides and actually don't see that CNBC video. So my apologies there. I will add it in, and I'm linking it now in the Agenda doc. It's a few minutes, but I would say take a look at that. It definitely encompasses the global conversation on it. And you'll notice the GitLab section takes a hard right turn, but it's one you want to root for. Awesome. David, looks like you have the next question. All right, so I know that you talk to many other organizations as well, either to help them with questions about going all remote or to learn from them to develop new synergies. I'd be interested to know which other organizations outside of GitLab you find are going all remote in what you would think of a remarkable way as well. And also if there's anything that we. Can learn from them. This is a great question. I will say the vast majority of organizations that I've seen are going hybrid. There's a small list of those that I'm aware of that are going all remote. Most of the ones I know that are going all remote are very small skift skift is a phenomenal travel publication, but they're a relatively small team. They had an office in New York. I'm friends with the editor there and he was talking to me early on. He said, I think we're just going to let the lease expire and we'll figure out how to do this. It's a lot easier for a smaller team. There's a lot less wheels in motion. There's a lot less legacy to undo. I think the jury is still out on companies that are transitioning all remote and getting completely away from the office. But I will say what I'm really encouraged is a lot of companies are shifting away from the office mentality. So although the physical office space may continue to exist, shopify is a great example of this. They're calling their approach digital first? I think it is. And they're going to maintain one key office, but I suspect they'll probably just turn it into like an experiential museum where they hang their awards up. It's less about where work gets done. That's pretty cool. I think if they can pull that off, they're already a public company. Strong growth, strong numbers, but they were very colocated and they hired a team that was bought into that culture and now they're shifting that culture in a major way. So I'm excited to watch them. That's one that comes to mind. We also have a transition and hybrid remote handbook page, and I'm actively tracking companies that are transitioning to hybrid. And I have a section there on Blueprints for companies that are doing it well, so that's more hybrid. As I get more companies that are going all remote, we should probably have a Blueprint section on all remote. HubSpot is another great example that comes to mind. They're definitely going hybrid and they're being very intentional about it, but the intentionality is worth praising and building in public. I've been very encouraged by how many companies are building in public. I want to give one other shout out to Dropbox. They're calling their approach Virtual First, and they're looking at the organizational design principles in how they make this shift. And actually, our handbook was made better by some of their early virtual first principles. I was reading their early communication guide and they had a section on examples of things to say when you want to decline a meeting in favor of async. So they literally gave people copy and pastable nuggets to decline a meeting in favor of Async. I thought this was brilliant because it shifts the burden from the person. There's no awkward spinning of, what is this person going to think if I decline the meeting? Will they see it as a personal affront? Takes all of that aside and says, this is because it's more respectful of your time if we can do this in an asynchronous way. So we adapted that, modified that, and added that to our handbook and, of course, gave them credit. Excellent. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Jessica, for the great notes. Yes, thank you very much for that, Jessica. Josh on to you. Cool. I think I got the next one. Wore my jacket just for this meeting. No, I'm kidding. But. I've been at GitLab for about nine months now, and I feel like using the tool GitLab to work remotely is just really efficient using issues and Mrs, the transparency, the collaboration. And I'm trying to struggle how other all remote companies work remotely without using GitLab. So I'm curious, have you seen organizations purchasing or using GitLab to manage and work remotely specifically? I don't know about specifically, but I've definitely seen companies who are already using GitLab for the conventional things you would use GitLab for, eager to learn how to use more of it in new ways. So we've had a lot of existing clients come back to us, either our sales team or me directly and say, hey, we're already a user of GitLab. Now our team's all remote. I think I remember your team, but somewhere along the way mentioning that you're all remote, like, what else can we learn from this? And we've been able to have some fascinating conversations on how we use it for project management outside of software engineering, and it's very eye opening for people. I think one of the most eye opening things about us showing people how we use GitLab is the transparency that comes along with it. And that's something that they weren't necessarily seeking when they asked the question. But once they see it, you can't ever unsee it and you can't ever think about working in any other way. And especially for chief people officers, there's this present question right now on how do we increase belonging? There's a bit of a social decay that comes with not being able to see someone in person over a year. And even the most seasoned veterans of remote are kind of feeling their social reservoir depleted. And it's giving us a great opportunity to show the connection and parallel between transparency and belonging. If you collaborate in a tool that's more transparent, it's more easy to see how others are working and what they're working on. There's a lower burden to entry and just having visibility, you just feel like you belong even if you don't do anything with that, if you don't provide any feedback or input, you don't switch teams. Just knowing that it's there and knowing that you can get there creates this sense of calm and belonging. So that's been a fun conversation to have, and I think there's a lot of opportunity there. Last year we did spin up a solutions page specific for remote teams, and we have a really awesome video that's embedded in that. So we do share that around in webinars and panels and things of that nature. But yeah, I think it's a huge opportunity now. So many people know GitLab for our organizational design now, so many people instinctively associate the word remote with GitLab and inevitably it's going to deplete over into our product. We actually have an OKR where we help sales conversations where we can just to provide that remote input. Whether or not they use it for the project management, it's still useful for them to know that it is possible and it gives them added transparency in their work. Thanks, Karen. Sure. Grant, you've got the next question. Yeah, I was just wondering your thoughts about the recent salesforce news that they announced. They're going to be doing standard hybrid, as you say, which seems to be the standard approach now, either office half office half not, or full remote. But what was interesting to me is that I found that as part of that announcement, they said that they're going to offer fully remote, but they declared a nine to five workday is dead. And I saw actually a lot of negative reaction to that particular piece because that meant people obviously more cynical hats on, which I can understand, means that it's not nine to five, so it'll be like nine to nine or nine to X or worse. It's a 24/7 on call scenario where the barriers of work life and home life are just completely disintegrated. I was wondering if you had any thoughts around that or if you've seen that kind of response out there. It's a totally valid concern. For a long time, people have had the commute in and the commute out as the effective barrier to where work starts and where it ends. So we were never really trained or conditioned to manage it on our own. At GitLab, we're managers of one, so I think we do a fairly good job at being able to manage to be. It's a looming crisis and I think it's going to be on leadership to really reinforce and empower that you still need to manage your day and not just let it run over. And a lot of this is going to fall to leaders. If you expect your people to take four to six weeks of vacation and you set OKRs, that require 52 weeks of work, what do you think is going to happen? Like self preservation is going to kick in and they will end up working 52 weeks, you have to leave from the front and make sure that you set the stage that allows people to do that. I do think it's a concern and it's something that we definitely want to approach in the content that we share and give people visibility onto how to do it well so they don't default to essentially creating a bunch of burnout. Thanks for the time check. Stephanie, zach, looks like you have the next question. Yeah. So I'm curious. I know that we have a lot of really good remote content and some of that content has been heavily, heavily shared and tons and tons of downloads. So we generate a lot of leads with some of this remote content. I'm curious the opportunity that we might have to kind of bridge the all remote content to sales leads funnels. And I say that with the caveat of ensuring that we do it in a very soft approach and not forceful and just universally say, because you downloaded remote content we want to sell to you. I think that's important to say. But also, I do feel like there's probably some opportunity there. And I would be curious, from your Jessica's perspective, what that opportunity might look. And then Jessica's making a note here. She's thought deeply about this. I'll see the floor to her. What we're seeing is that although we're designing this for awareness, it's great content. It's highly actionable. It is exactly the thing that most people have been needing. It is the proverbial oasis in the desert. So what ends up happening is it creates this positive halo effect that if you help someone solve their remote problem, they just believe your brand. So, like, oh, you can solve my collaboration problem and my DevOps problem and all of these other problems. So without us even categorizing it as that we're getting a lot of halo effect. But I do want to let Jessica have the last say on this. Yeah, I'm typing furiously. But I'll verbalize. So we've been having a lot of conversations about this for a long time. And knowing that we only have a minute left, I will quickly say that mostly we fit in at the top of the funnel awareness. And so it is difficult to bridge that to the sales funnel. But recently, we've been seeing more of an opportunity to come in partway through the funnel, where you're working with someone already and they want to know more about remote. And that's where we are happy to come and have conversation, help build a relationship, give people information that they need. And that is exciting for us to be part of the process of just building a good relationship with someone. So I think that's an opportunity to think about in the future and we can see how to sort of make that work. Bridging the funnels is not something that we have figured out yet, but we are sciency it out and we'll get there. Awesome. Thank you. Cool. Looks like we are at time. This was an awesome and engaging conversation, as always. Thanks all for joining. Check us out in the remote channel.",

        "transcript_text": "You. Hello, everyone. Today is Thursday, February 4, and you've got the Inbound Marketing team together for our weekly recap. I'm going to start us off with a new section that I'd like to add for this quarter, and I'm hoping people will add things here for this time and in the future. I'd love to have us share more about moments of insight we're having, things we're learning, where we say, wow, I didn't know that. Whether it's about work or leadership or management or personal stuff, just to give us a space to talk about that. Because I think I've heard a lot of really cool examples of this in one on ones in other places, but it doesn't always happen that we share them here as a group. And I'm hoping this will be a way for us to feel a little more connected to each other through the week since we don't have a lot of recurring meetings. So I'll share one as an example and then Laura, I love that you've added one here already, so I'm looking forward to hearing about that. So, as some of you know, I'm going through an executive coaching training program right now, partly because I think it'll be amazing to become a coach, but also because I think a huge part of my role as I progress in my career is coaching other people. And I really would love to just become skillful in that so that I can help people get where they want to go in their goals and dreams. And so this quote really hit me for some reason, so I'll just read it to you. This is kind of referring to being mentally in a place where you can be fully checked into a meeting with a person. And the quote is, your presence is an intervention. And for some reason it just hit for me, like, wow, just actually fully showing up, like eye contact with the camera, ready to rock, completely zoned in on the person that I'm talking to for that 25 minutes is an intervention that's actually giving someone else something they need. So I'm personally taking that as a bit of a co on. So as I go into meetings, like, okay, am I really here? Am I really here for these people? And I don't know, it just hit for me, so I wanted to share it. So Laura, do you want to share yours? Sure. Mine is a lot less profound, but I had a meeting with Tyler that was supposed to be a Ruby indoctrination meeting, but turned into me kind of mentioning like, man, I can't seem to edit HAML files. I think Middleman personally hates me. And he was like, oh no, that's just like, just be patient. This is how the bill process works. As soon as you finish waiting, wait a little bit more, and then finally you'll see your changes reflected. And that was really helpful and just not just because I learned how to edit YAML files, but in general having a better understanding of what's happening behind the scenes during our build. So also shout out to Tyler for that. Thank you. Now that everyone's seen this example, anyone else want to jump in? I know you probably didn't have time to write, but anyone want to jump in, share anything else they learned this week? I have something. Oh, go ahead, Tyler. Thanks. I started reading the High Output Management book this week, just maybe a chapter in, but the first insight is how clearly influential that's been for GitLab in terms of processes and organizational structure. But there's this thing that's been sticking with me about and I haven't gotten to the details in the book yet, but about managing people who are doing work and motivating them the way that athletes are motivated to do their personal best. And thinking a lot about how I've sort of implicitly felt that here in the past couple of months and seen it from the people around me and how different that is here than it is at other places I've worked. And yeah, it's just like starting to form my head. I don't have more insight about it, but really the observational power of it has been really cool this week. That's great. Great book. Cool. I just wanted to link a YouTube video and it's called how to Speak More Confidently in Meetings. And some of the core tenets I'm just going to go over really quickly is just slowing down when you talk and being more comfortable with pauses. I tried to practice one right there where it's like you tried to cut down your use of filler words. So I really recommend the watch. It's really interesting and I wasn't sure if I was going to bring that up or a joke one, but I've been sleeping with my blinds open and it's been life changing in terms of waking up early. So that's my fun fact one. Anybody else? Last call. All right, Michael, why don't you take it away? Absolutely. I love that new addition, Daniel. This is going to be so great to learn from everybody. So show and tell. I love seeing what everybody makes every week. So let's stick to the agenda here. Sharing screen makes it even more real. So if you could do that, that'd be awesome. Looks like, Lauren, we've got you up first. Yeah, I'll share my screen right here. So this week, last week we hit a bug with Netlify CMS. There's an API error that was due to us timing out during a rebase and I submitted an issue with Netlify CMS on GitHub and they fixed it. So this contributor came in, said, oh, well, we can just increase the timeout to 30 seconds. And it was solved, which is super cool. Now I know where that code is in their code base and we can work to contribute back to Netlify CMS. Awesome. Looks like you're up next, Javi. Cool. Something I just wanted to bring up really quickly in terms of things that I've been working on. Give me 1 second. Let me just share my screen is I've been working with the engineering efforts in Digital Experience to try to get more clarity in terms of what are the things that are blocking us in terms of our workflow. We decided with going with a workshop, which is just essentially a way of trying to get us to agree upon something really quickly. Usually workshops last about a couple of hours. For our team specifically. We did it over the course of two weeks with 1 hour each and it's essentially like having this crazy figma file with all these people trying to collaborate at the same time. And I just wanted to kind of bring up some of the insights that we got from that. It led us to kind of like these questions that then got filled out into issues for the next OKR, which I think is really awesome and it led to some really great discussion. I won't go through all of it here just because it's so much of it, but kind of like the big takeaway we have is like a site migration will not solve our pressing infra problems. If you've never done a workshop yourself, I link some resources here which I think are amazing and that do a better job than I can in like a brief moment to explain the value of them. But it's a lot of fun and I think a lot of the engineers can vouch that that effort was well used. So, yeah, that's it for me. Next I have Rebecca. Thank you. Sorry, it wouldn't let me share my screen until hubby had stopped. Okay, so, yeah, I am just going to give a quick recap of the Unfiltered blog from the last quarter. The cadence was meant to be monthly, but then the last two were over Thanksgiving and Christmas, so I figured I'd just bundle it all into the quarter. There is a spreadsheet if you really want to get deep into the individual numbers. But yeah, on the whole, we published fewer Unfiltered posts. That makes sense. There were a lot of holidays and these are team member Led posts, so it makes sense that number would go down. I wanted to call out in the top five. We've got some community focused ones, which is great to see because that's really what Unfiltered is for. It's a platform for our team members and the community to share, kind of peer to peer style. So excited to see that even though we published fewer posts, the number of unique views was up overall. So that's encouraging too, to see that hitting on some popular topics. We have published one on the main blog, this How Merge Trains Work, which thanks Will Spillane for calling that out. I think it was a great one to move over to the main blog and we should see traffic pick up once it gets pushed out on our usual channels. And I also added a column in this here noting to myself, ones that I've noticed I think would be a good fit for the main blog. So I've started opening issues for those. Yeah, that's unfiltered for the last quarter. I'll do a recap of the whole blog for the last quarter in the coming weeks, but I like to give it a little bit more time for those late January posts to get some traffic to get a fuller picture. So I will share that probably next week. Thanks. Over to brie. Thanks. I just wanted to take a moment and sort of share what the content team has created for the past quarter. I listed it out here, but I'll read it quickly. So we have 15 net new web articles, three updated topics pages, one new topics page, three ebooks, five new blogs, seven blogs that were repurposed as web articles written about 60, probably more campaign emails, six published case studies. Six more written case studies this quarter and the creation and distribution of the brand new DevOps download newsletter that Val had pushed for and made happen this past quarter with a great oh, OK, I will shout them out in the shout out section. I have one other thing that I'll just keep moving forward. I am the newest DRI for the localization project, starting to lead this moving forward. There's a lot to unpack still, so I don't really have much to share, but it just means wrapping my head around the entire scope of the project including the priority countries, the budget, the go to market motions and the expectations needs of the various groups. It's not just translation, it also includes getting organized and streamlined so that we can efficiently and effectively get the translations going and going well. Becky has been super helpful, which I will add this to the shout out section too, but I've basically gotten to pick her brain and I will probably need to pick her brain a whole lot more. But there will be more to come with this project in the next few weeks. Hey Bree, can you take just 1 second to explain DRI? Just because I know there's some people here who are newer to GitLab know much about that yet. So for this project in particular, there's a lot of moving parts. And I think that what needs to have happen here is there needs to be one point person who can take all of the moving parts, organize them together, make sure that all groups are represented fairly and equally and understand what the needs are between the budget, between the countries. Between what the priority of the go to market or the use case is for each country. And also be the point person for if there are questions and they need answers quickly and sort of just establishing a process in place so that in a year from now, it won't be a messy situation, it will be streamlined, so there won't be questions. It's kind of getting that process up and organized to that point so that we can just be a streamlined localization. Did that clarify it at all? Yeah, that's great. Hopefully everyone here has heard the team DRI before, but if not, I did also just drop the handbook link. A lot of thoughts gone into, know, evolving that role over time. So check it out. And Val is next. Okay, I guess I'll share my screen. Although I dropped this in the document. Let's see. Sorry, I'm never very good at the screen sharing. Okay, so you see before you the thing I am happiest about this quarter so far. We discovered last year in trying to promote the developer survey that we had a hard time getting people to take it. But if you give people a T shirt, they will take it. So this lovely design from our very own fabulously talented Vic Bell uses a phrase we got from the survey last year of a person who said, in answer to what are your job responsibilities? This person wrote in, I am DevOps. So we saved that idea. We've now put this on T shirts. And this will be part of a multifaceted giveaway to incentivize folks to take the survey this year. So, survey launches next week. Very exciting. And those of you who actually are reading the agenda may feel free to message me. If you've actually read the agenda and see the last line I left in there as a little gift to all of you, if you send me your T shirt size, I might be able to get you a T shirt. So let me know. Sorry, I lost it. Who's next? I was wondering, are we giving credit to that individual who submitted that? That could be such a cool moment for them to be like, oh, wow, they listened to me and they're using a phrase that I shared. I'm funny. Awesome. Wouldn't that be lovely? Our survey is due to a myriad of GDPR issues. Anonymous got it. So we don't have the opportunity to do that. I'm hoping that this person sees this this year and hopefully we'll raise his or her hand, but no. I wish I could, but I can't. But I have to say, it's still a great freaking slogan. So I'm kind of okay over to Niall. Thanks. All right, I'll just quickly share my screen. So this is just to highlight some of the findings from our Q Four analysis with Saul. So I'd already published this in the marketing channel. We just wanted to highlight it here as well. So it's generally a result of a lot of work that's taken part throughout the year, last year as well as in the last quarter across teams, such as looking at site health and stuff such as the handbook, mash error and all that kind of stuff, but we've seen really good results. So for keyword positioning, we have overall from eleven to 100, we're up 68,000. For fourth ten position, it's nearly two and a half thousand, and in the top three, that's plus 1131. So in terms of visibility, we're really kind of at an all time high. So it's just good to see, even though there's a lot of sprint work that goes in for smaller projects, it's good to see the overall result at the end of the year. So I just want to share that there. And I shall hand it over to Becky. Oh, you can view the video as well. Sorry. There's a link there from Salt to a 15 minutes video. So to Becky. I think Becky's doing CMO shadow so I can cover for her. Looks like Becky's put a bunch of stuff in here about Michael so that. The video is high quality, please. Yeah, absolutely. Put a bunch of stuff in here about what Saul's done. So completed phase one of website, localization strategy for website and URL naming structure with Niall's help handing to Brie. Completed phase one and two, the partner website refresh. So that included strategy, URL folder structure, URL naming, redrex, SEO research and navigation bar. Working with me, establishing baseline productivity for cross functional requests. Still collecting. Why? Why? Becky asked us to add weight to all issues and we have another update to the handbook soon launched with the support of many, a new tone of voice and thorough guidelines. This isn't her words, but if you haven't watched the video, it's really good. And Ash, I really enjoyed the work you did there. Completed one of the first corporate marketing campaign messaging projects. So high level person first with some thematic elements. Iterated on the OKR structure, on feedback. She has a video that's helpful to understand the why and the what she's doing. Working through aligning strategy for all our teams. Not sure how successful we've been yet, but I think we're all at least heading in the same direction. And also FY 22 budget set up quarterized and aligned to business strategy. So I'll keep playing Becky and we'll move into shout out. So anyone who wants to contribute, let's express some gratitude for people that have helped us. And I'm just going to keep standing on my soapbox and talking because I've got the first three here, so I wanted to say thank you. Danielle. The group conversation on Tuesday went well. The team did so much amazing work, so I had confidence. I've been describing it as me. I wasn't nervous, but I wasn't not nervous. So thanks a lot for driving that conversation. It was awesome. Tyler, thanks for taking the time and the initiative on improving the middleman builds without getting too like. This is one of those things where you fix one thing once and it makes everything better forever. So it's massive. I can't can't even understand how you did that. In I think US Sunday just kind of hanging out and then Brandon and some the pricing page redesign has kind of heated up. There's a lot of opportunity in kind of we pivoted and started to do a few faster iterations and A B tests that weren't necessarily in our plan, but we saw the importance and we're open to changing plan. And then lauren. Hello. There you are. I wanted to give a shout out to Michael for implementing our MVC two sprint cycle for Digital Experience Team. It really enables our team to work more asynchronously while it's challenging us to be efficient during our sync meetings. So we only have 30 minutes. We've really got to work async before we meet so that we make that time efficient. So thank you. All right, Michael, you're just getting a lot of praise. I hope your ego doesn't get too big this week. Michael, great job on the preparation delivery of the inbound marketing group conversation, the deck and the presentation video ahead of time enabled a much better, more engaged, more informed discussion, and you made our team and your team just look really good. So awesome job. Becky, I know you're not here, but I just want to thank Becky for wrangling to get the final FY 22 budget squared away in Alocadia, it was pretty complicated. We were asked to spend a little less than last year and deliver a whole lot more, but I think we've got a good plan in place, and we're going into the year with the most clarity we've ever had around the budget. So while I do think things may shift around a bit at the mid year point, especially if things are going well, we may want to deploy some more capital. At least right now, we have a very clear go forward plan. If you don't feel that way, reach out to Becky. She'll get you up to speed real quick. I'm sorry. Not everyone can have allocated seats. They're, I think, a month per user, so it just didn't make sense to give them to everyone. But that doesn't mean you're not allowed to see the budget, so we'll figure out a way we can continue to communicate that. And then also, Shane Rice also not here because he's over in CEO shadowland. We miss you, but you're clearly having a fantastic time. You make us look good. I've seen you in some meetings. Can't wait to hear about what you've learned. And lastly, Bree, huge thanks to you for taking on the localization DRI role. I think that's going to be a very impactful move, not just for our team, but for the company. So very happy that you're doing it. And next up is Val. Okay, I just wanted to give big love and gratitude to Vic for her amazing T shirt design. Thank Will for being my ride or die on every facet of the Dub survey. He's just terrific and sort of do an advanced please put up with me as I stress out next week teammates Bree, Suri and Chrissy, because the survey launch is usually kind of stressful. OK. Over to Tyler. Awesome. Thanks to Brandon, I had an Mr that was just in draft. I hadn't pinged anyone on it, and I was really grateful. Brandon just poked in and looked around and gave me some proactive feedback on it. I was like, oh, awesome. And it was super helpful. Told me about a gotcha that I could not have known about without some institutional knowledge and helped me resolve it. And, yeah, just thanks to Brandon for doing that and for taking the time and being super. Yeah, yeah, I got it. I just wanted to shout out to Christy Valensuri for their large amount of content output that they did for the last quarter, which I shared previously, and just to say that it is a lot of work and it's great, and I hope it continues for this quarter. And also thanks to Becky and Tadara for letting me ask a million questions about the localization project. I will have a million more, so thanks in advance. And Rebecca is up. I just wanted to shout out heather Simpson wrote two of our top five unfiltered posts for Q four, so congrats to her and also to John Coughlin, Megan Maneville, and Rihanna Farissimo. I'm sorry if I'm saying anyone's names wrong. You wrote the rest of the top five, so good work there. Over to Brock. Yeah, I just wanted to shout out to Erica Flowers. Last Friday during fiscal end, I had to kind of basically drop work to react to a government announcement in Canada, and that left a lot on Erica, and I'm aware of that. And I'm really grateful to work in a place where something like that can happen. And it's okay for me to just go deal with know that means a lot to me. And it means a lot to me to work for an organization that supports that. But in particular, Erica, I'm just really grateful because I know that wasn't easy, and it means a lot. Thank you. Thanks, brother. You did this in time. Anybody have time left? Okay, well, I'll see you all in the next meeting in 30 minutes. If you shared something really cool in here that you want to show off, take it over to that other agenda doc. See you all soon. Great first week of the fiscal year. Bye.",

        "transcript_text": "The good guys. Why, then, do you and Hillary want to control and restrict and limit gun manufacturers, gun owners, and the responsible use of guns and ammunition to the rest of us, the good guys, instead of holding the bad guys accountable for their actions? And, Mr. President, if I may, I'd like to use Chicago, your hometown, a city that has some of the strictest unlaws in the nation, a city that for decades and still is under Democratic control. A city that has an outrageous and even embarrassing murder rate as my first example. Why can't we round up these thugs, these drug dealers and gang members, and hold them accountable for their actions or allow the good people in Chicago access to firearms to protect themselves? Good. All right. Well, it's a multi part question, so let me just say a couple things. First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell bent on taking away folks'guns is just not and I don't care how many times the NRA says it, I'm about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I've been president than just about any time in U. S. History. There are enough guns for every man, woman, and child in this country, and at no point have I ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it's just not true. What I have said is precisely what you suggested, which is, why don't we treat this like every other thing that we use? We used to have really bad auto fatality rates. The auto fatality rate has actually dropped precipitously drastically since I was a kid. Why is that? We decided we had seatbelt laws. We decided to have manufacturers put airbags in place. We decided to crack down on drunk driving and texting. We decided to redesign roads so that they were less likely to have a car bank. We studied what is causing these fatalities using science and data and evidence, and then we slowly treated it like the public health problem was, and it got reduced. We are not allowed to do any of that when it comes to guns because people if you propose anything, it is suggested that we're trying to wipe away gun rights and impose tyranny in martial law. Do you know that Congress will not allow the center for Disease Control to study gun violence? They're not allowed to study it because the notion is that by studying it the same way we do with traffic accidents, somehow that's going to lead to everybody's guns being confiscated. When we talked about background checks, if you buy a car, if you want to get a license, first of all, you got to get a license. You have to take a test. People have to know that you know how to drive. You don't have to do any of that with respect to buying a gun. And when we talked about doing effective background checks. It was resisted because the notion was we were going to take your guns away. I just came from a meeting today in the situation room in which I've got people who we know have been on ISIL websites living here in the United States, u. S. Citizens, and we're allowed to put them on the no fly list when it comes to airlines. But because of the national rifle association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun. This is somebody who is a known ISO sympathizer, and if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as many weapons as ammo as he can, nothing's prohibiting from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is. So, sir, I just have to say respectfully that there is a way for us to have common sense gun laws. There is a way for us to make sure that lawful, responsible gun owners like yourself are able to use it for sporting, hunting, protecting yourself. But the only way we're going to do that is if we don't have a situation in which anything that is proposed is viewed as some tyrannical destruction of the second amendment. And that's how the issue too often gets framed.",

        "transcript_text": "This is California, and to some, it is no longer their home. I did think that I was going to stay here forever. Every single one of these houses was completely burnt. My california dream. Is it's done? In the span of two years, california's population has dropped by more than a half million people. Oracle's stunning announcement that after decades in Silicon Valley, its move moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas. And new this morning, Tesla says it's officially moved its corporate headquarters from just outside of Austin. There's a good chance you may know someone who left the state over the past two years. A golden state exodus and a Lone Star state explosion. But is it true? Join us as we meet some Californians making the move to see if the grass in Texas is really greener. I was assaulted twice on the far. Never had a house this large in my life. It is definitely a lower cost of living in Texas. The home that I once remembered and knew back in the 1980s and the 1990s. A lot of that's gone now. Are you in? My Facebook group moved to Texas from California. I'm Karina Nova. California Dreaming is all about looking at the challenges facing the Golden State and the people trying to come up with potential solutions. We all know our state faces some major challenges and those may not be solved overnight. For most Californians, the positive aspects of our state far outweigh the challenges we face. But for a small group of Californians, the problems are enough to push them to leave the state they love. Making things better often takes some critical self reflection. So today we're going to do that with these former Californians in an effort to learn how we might be able to make things better for the rest of us. Whether it's people moving or companies moving, it feels like there are more people trading the Golden State for the Lone Star State. But is that really true? The short answer is yes. The number of Californians moving to Texas has gone up in the past few years, but actually it's been steadily increasing since 2009. And in 2018, that number jumped. If you added up all the people who moved to and from Texas within the United States, 34% came from California. Now, people from Texas have also been moving to California, but that number has stayed about the same over the past ten years. So when we compare the estimated net flow of people between the states from 2017 to 2019, texas has a two to one advantage. For the last three years, we had to turn to other sources. That helps us fill in the blanks. Move buddha is a relocation website. It calculates costs for people planning to make a move from state to state and gives insight into moving trends before they happen. Their most popular searches over the last few years were from cities in California to Texas. And that's not all. Looking at Texas driver's license applications where people listed California as their last residence, the numbers have been steadily increasing for the last ten years. Okay, so I think it's safe to say that Californians are moving to Texas. But let's put the numbers in context. Of the almost 40 million people living in California, the total number of people leaving the state each year makes up less than 1%. But it's true the majority of those people are indeed heading to Texas. Let's meet some of them. I think Texas is attractive for the same reasons that Arizona and Nevada are attractive, which is that home prices are lower and there's plenty of job opportunities. When I was the mayor of Ventura, the thing that I treasured the most was that most of the people who lived in town also worked in town. It was a complete community. And one of the things I tried to do as mayor was to protect that and ensure that that could continue. That requires building more housing so that young families can afford to live there. And that really hasn't happened. So one of the things I greatly fear about Ventura and elsewhere in coastal California is that it's not a place for everybody anymore, and especially not a place for young families. It's a place, basically, where older, affluent people now live. And I think something has really been lost there. Those are the people who are moving to places like Texas. Generally speaking, home prices in Texas cost less than half of homes in California. U. S. Census Bureau numbers show that the middle and lower classes are leaving California at a higher rate than the wealthy. Many who have left in recent years say they simply couldn't afford to stay. My name is Jennifer Baylick, and I am from Ventura County. I am the mom to six kids. We are a blended family, a big baelic bunch, and we moved to Texas in April of 2021 to try to live the American dream. We were not doing that in California. Being a big family, we really needed the space to house everybody comfortably without being super squished. So it was really not even a thing for us to be able to buy out there what we needed to provide for our family. So I feel like the California dream was the American dream in my grandparents and my parents era. That's just not possible for our generation to live that American dream in that state anymore. It's so expensive that you're struggling every month just to get by and pay your rent and your mortgage and put food on the table. So I really just feel like it's unattainable there right now. Welcome back. We've heard how housing affordability is closely tied to more Californians leaving the Golden State. But when you combine housing, goods and services altogether into real purchasing power for people, california is 15% more expensive to live in than the overall United States. I have my own food truck. Unfortunately, it was getting too expensive. The reason why I left California, honestly, is just the cost. The cost of living, the cost of running a business. Regulations. Happy birthday to you. It is right now, it's 03:00 a.m. In the morning. I got to check in by 04:00. Our plane leaves at five. And this week what we are going to find out is number one is location where we can park our food truck. We're in San Antonio, Texas right now. We came to this food park to come and check it out. It's called the point. It's pretty neat, honestly. So far our move has been excellent. I can't complain. We did the move from Paris, California to San Antonio, Texas in 26 hours. I lived 2 hours away from Disneyland. I used to go to Disneyland one day and spend $1,500 and I was already nervous the next day because I spent too much money. How is it that I see families coming from Texas, from other states and they're spending a whole week in Disneyland? Imagine what the cost it is to stay at the hotel and they can afford to stay there for all week. And I live 60 miles and I can barely afford to go there once a year. So there's something wrong there. So that's the reason why I say my California dream is it's done. Hey, it's Marie here and it is Friday, February 11, and I'm here to meet clients that are just about to go under contract. They've been waiting a few weeks. They've been on the waiting list for several weeks. And the builder actually is locking the doors because so many people want to come in because they've heard that they're contracting. So it was a big deal to get my clients in here today and all the construction going on. You guys can see just everywhere you hey, there it is. Thursday, February 3. Very cold today in Texas. It's one of those days where it's snowing. So when I start working, I usually go and check the Facebook group move to Texas from California and we add members into the group. We actually don't add every single person to the group. The reason that we do that is because we've had a lot of trolls in the past. There's actually like people that tried to get our group taken down because some people think that Californians are here to change Texas and that's actually not the case. With so many Californians moving to Texas, some worry the political makeup of the state is going to change. But maybe those worries are overblown. In fact, some people are moving to Texas because of their conservative values. Hi there. My name is Simon Black and this is my wife Brigitte Black. And we were originally from California. We had lived there our entire lives, 46 years. I was born in Berkeley and my wife here was born in Walnut Creek. Ah. It seems that the environment politically in California has just been a one party rule. Republicans have done absolutely nothing to change anything in any way. It seems to me they've been cowardly about it. I joined a conservative group and I'm meeting a lot of like minded people and new friends and it's very sad. In Contra Costa County. You can't even be conservative. You kind of have to hide if you're conservative almost. I mean, my friend just joined a group in Contra Costa County and she said it's literally a secret group. From politics to housing prices to safety. Another reason why some people say they are leaving the Golden State. My family is originally from South Korea, and we immigrated in 1972 when I was a baby and we lived in Los Angeles most of our life. We own grocery markets. Unfortunately, my parents'grocery stores were burned down in the La Wrights, two of them near Koreatown. And so that was quite a traumatic experience for my family. A lot of things happened in between, but we stayed true to California, the Golden State. California is utterly a beautiful state. I mean, there's no denying that. Everybody that I know that has moved from California to Texas, they all say, yeah, we miss the beach, we miss the scenery. I used to go camping. I think I've hit almost every national forest in Know. It was hard to give that up. So with that said, I definitely think that the state is mismanaged. We moved primarily because of the crime, and for me, it was not only the crime, but also the amount of homelessness needles. I was assaulted twice on the Bart. Those particular assaults, I really do think it had to do with the same kind of violence that I saw in the Bay Area towards Asian Americans. What's the filming about that's going on right now? They're covering stories of people who are moving to Texas. Yeah, a friend of mine moved there just a few years ago due to the fires. Landlord wanted to take over the rental that he was running to him because his house burned down. So my friend was forced out and done with California, so he picked Texas. I think the fires was just the first inkling that something was like, not perfect about Sonoma County. Day five. Working in triple digit heat, surrounded in dense black smoke, frightened residents rush to escape the firestorm sweeping through California's wine country. Tens of thousands of acres have been devastated by the fires. I've had to evacuate my parents up in Wikipedia for several fires. For one of them, they had to come stay with me for about ten days before they could go back home. That part kind of wears on you. After a while. I did think that I was going to stay here forever. I actually thought I would die in my house or something. Like I was never going to leave. After the campfire after doing some volunteer work up there, that was very hard for me. I just couldn't bear the grief anymore. It really broke my heart. It totally shook my sense of having grown up in this really safe community. All of this has been rebuilt. All of this was burnt land. Every single one of these houses was completely burnt. I'm a sucker for old houses, though. I love old victorians. This is like probably what I'm going to miss the most is the JC neighborhood with all these beautiful old homes. The brush has grown up so much. It's just like another fire hazard waiting. Look at all that. There's one that's totally scorched. So we know they're moving. We know why they're moving. But is the grass in Texas really greener? Is that big move paying off or are these former residents having buyer's remorse? We circled back to them a year later to see how they're feeling. I miss my friends and my family. That's the main miss. I miss the ocean a little bit. I miss the ocean, but not enough to move back. Yeah, I do miss I do miss a little bit being able to drive to reno. Now we do have oklahoma, which has a couple of big casinos, but it's not quite the same as it is going to reno because there is a main strip there. There's lots of other casinos. South shore tahoe is very beautiful. I do miss that a little bit. Also as a 49 er fan, die hard since I was eight, I've got some other friends here that are also 49 er fans, but of course that's not the majority and I knew that from the beginning. I do miss being in a place where everybody roots for the same team for the most part. And of course, the sun sets over the bay are very beautiful. I kind of enjoyed highway 24 a little bit driving through rendon lafayette. I do miss that. But again, we'd have the same house, the 1600 square footer that we hadn't conquered. And I think about that and then while I miss those other things, it doesn't bother me quite as much when I think about it. I do miss togo's restaurants. They don't have any out here. And there was a restaurant. There is a restaurant, susan hill, the back 40 texas barbecue, which is actually really good and it's kind of hard to find a balance. If I would ever move back to california, it's very small, open ended, number one, the whole state would have to clean up, get some of those rotten politicians, be tough on crime again like you should. People's attitudes would just have to change. But for the most part, I really am happy here. I have very little desire to move back. As a whole. We were a little afraid that we weren't going to make good friends here. But I have 14 people coming to my birthday party this weekend so we were able to make friends a lot quicker here. Yeah, we've been here like year and eight months now. My commute is seven minutes to work. I have plenty of time to spend with my wife and help her with her business. My wife feels completely safe here and that really was the major criteria for moving here. The things that I miss about California, I miss my mom the most. My mom's there in Riverside, California. Honestly, my daughter I have a daughter there as well, too, in California. Being so close to Tijuana, Baja California, be able to take off for two days. Me and my wife go get our fix on different food that we're missing from there already. And unfortunately, I'm 1300 miles away now and it's not that easy. The only way that I would go back is if my mom wouldn't want to come here to Texas with me. So depending if my mom really likes it here and we can make life, I would stay here in Texas. But if not, I would move back to California. Or if there's a right business opportunity back in California, so it could be a maybe. The girls are doing choir and art and my son has totally picked up fishing. Loves fishing. Wants to go to the pond to go fishing every single day. So that's kind of cool off the video game, doing something outside. I love it. So yeah, they're super happy too. They're all doing really well in school. Yeah. We definitely have not even contemplated moving back. We are just really happy out here. We don't mind at all if people talk about regretting moving. Not everyone is going to be happy moving across country. Most people will talk about the weather because it's definitely hotter in the summer. They will talk about, we do have higher property tax percentage rates. It doesn't always mean that the amount they pay is going to be more, but we do have higher property tax percentage rates. And then of course, people miss their families now. I've lived in Texas for 14 months outside of Houston. I really miss the beauty, the natural beauty of Sonoma County. I'm going to really make an effort this year to try to meet more people so that I really give it my best shot there. But if I don't end up making more friends there, I probably will come back just because I care so much about the people who are here. I did not sell my house here, so I left that option open. But I think that this will always feel like home to me. I've only been in Texas for 14 months, so we'll see. Might go back and I might stay there. Texas and California are both great places and they have different pros and cons. I might, I might stay here I might go back if you define the American dream as living in a big house on a big lot. Yes, it's easier to live in Texas, but California is still a great place for people to pursue their dreams, depending on what they're looking for. We've heard the reasons, from housing to politics to safety. As to why people are leaving California, it's still not what those headlines are claiming. A mass exodus? No, California is still a place where people are choosing to call home ram.",

        "transcript_text": "Awesome. Well, thank you everyone for joining and welcome to our first session of Release Managers Fire Drills and Chats. So the purpose of this session is to improve the release manager experience by sharing knowledge and skills with others. The examples or discussions set here are basically be scenarios that release managers have faced in the past or discussions about processes that are not 100% clear. Now for this knowledge sharing session to work, participation is required from everyone because otherwise this is going to be a monologue and it doesn't make sense to be a monologue. So I will also appreciate if someone can take notes. That would be great. So let's just get started. So I'm going to read an scenario and then I'm going to ask you the question and then we can start the discussion. Right? So for the first scenario, it is a straightforward one, so let's see how it goes. So we have an S two incident that has been open and it impacts the GitHub.com availability. This incident, the root cause has not been determined. So because of it, the AOC pulls Release Managers to the incident channel. You can read that as the Slack channel or the Zoom meeting and then ask them to help them determine if the root cause is associated with the deployments. So as release managers, what are your next steps here? So what do you do to help? I can jump in. So what I would do is I would ask if it's been identified on any sort of like grafana type charting or if it can be viewed through any of that charting, and then we can look at the overlay of deployments against it to see if it happened to line up. That would be kind of my first inclination of one way to see if it might have to do with a given deployment. Also, I think usually we check the Lots deployment timing with the Steve said, like with the current timing of the incident, usually we check the dashboard to see if the RPS are getting high or whatever, something is down. After checking the timing, at least for me, I also go to check the def in the GitLab in the announcement channel. I check the Latice deployment, then I check the def in the GitLab.com UI to determine if there is an Mr there fishy or something. And this is really hard. I think we need something to basically make it easier for us to actually determine if an Mr is causing the incident or not. Because usually we check just from the UI and this is slow and not very effective, but sometimes it's there really. Also from some incidents I've been into, like I've seen Myra successfully actually checking VMR from the UI and linking. Yeah. Can I interject there? Myra and I talk about this a lot. When Myra does that, Myra is being a backend maintainer. So I think there's a separation of what we expect from a release manager. And so for those of you with SRE skill sets, you will probably be able to do things that as an SRE, with an SRE hat you can do. Those people with backend experience can do that. And I think as a release manager we don't have to do that. We are the experts on the process. You don't have to be able to identify the EBA if you want to see the worst version of both McKelley or I are your worst version of a release manager because we have neither SRE nor backend. We are just coordinating at that point. Yeah, for sure. I totally agree. I think as far as release managers go, it is basically as you mentioned to see, okay, if the Grafana dashboard correlates with a deployment, then find the deployment and take it from there. But it is not expectation from us to say like oh, this is the actual culprit, and then reverse that and then push it. That is not expected from release managers. All right, so to summarize, you mentioned checking the deployment, checking if it matches the Grafana chart and checking the last deployment from the announcements channel. And then what else can we do to determine if this was associated, if the incident is associated with the deployments. What about migrations for example? Do you think migrations could correlate with this? Yes. Also like running the migration could also correlate with this or the migrations that we do not execute that executed automatically. Also maybe it's also the cause. Is there an easy way to tell the EOC like oh hey, this deployment had migrations or like these were the last one executed, they might be helpful. I'm not sure if we have dashboard for it to be honest. But I think for me I check the migration job or the PDM if I executed something. Yeah, I agree. I mean certainly if we recently executed the PDM we would know. But as for the migrations, just running part of the pipeline, the way that I would know of is finding that job in the pipeline, clicking it and seeing did any migrations run, which I suppose does take a little bit of skill in reading the Ruby migration output or the Rails migration output. It's also trickier because of the Cannery stage as well. So you may have an incident, say, in production as you're rolling out in production. And something you have to keep in mind is that those migration for that package has run at the Cannery stage. So hours before and potentially every other package rolling out to Canary from that point, basically from every other package after that one that is ready reaching out into Canary, potentially affected with its own migration. So in terms of production, main stage incident is really tricky to figure out the real state compared to just identifying the deployment pipeline because every other after that could have an impact. Usually it should not because of how the migrations are, the regular migration are designed, but it's worth to keep in mind because we have this shared state. I also wanted to ask, I think we have it documented somewhere that what Alessio just said. I'm not sure to be honest, but I learned this that it runs on the Canary stage from Ruben, because I ask Ruben all the time so he mentioned it to me. So I learned it from Ruben but I'm not sure if it's documented somewhere. Does the migration run actually at the Canary stage? Even if it's production like migration problem? I think it is documented on the development side. I'm not sure if we have an overview of the migration lifecycle in our documentation from the release manager perspective. Yeah, maybe it's not stated out clearly. It's more side effect of what is cannery. So what services runs in Canary and where are the shared state and service? Do you all think it will be helpful to have some sort of way to tell all these deployment executed migrations or not? It could be a nice to have or like a requirement to help us on incidents. You know, those messages that come into coming release, right? If it's not too frequent then we can probably have it so that if a migration runs it sends a message or something like that as a way to keep track of the timestamp as well. Because I think we have annotations for deployments like on Grafana and when we execute post deployment migrations, we also leave a note on the release task issue which is not the same as annotation but it's recorder there. But perhaps there is a gap for regular migrations. Like perhaps we should annotate them as well or post a message on the release tax issue that this deployment triggered this or put a div in the slack channel or something to allow us to find them easily. Have we found incident in the past with this specific behavior? Because what I'm thinking from my experience, so limited to my time zone and my shift as release managers is that often so if it fails at a migration stage is something that we release managers identify and often is the case, then nothing is broken. It's more something like we are prevented to continue with deployment. So if we had to deploy something we are blocked. So there's no outage, that's what I want to say. So usually there's not an outage, it's just a migration partially applied or something broken so that we can't continue. And so we know hahad that this is why not really this is why, but we know that it failed on a migration. We have the job that failed and the job that failed tells us what migration was running and it's kind of an easy entry point into debugging this. Then there is the other thing which is we run post deployment migration and it failed at the post deployment migration stage. Again, same situation. You kind of have a very clear entry point into the issue. And then there are two other situations. One is I had a general failure, say a QA or something like that, and it may or may not be related to the migration just run. But often the case it's the EEOC coming up to the release manager with a clear incident declaration and they already know if it's coming from the database. So usually they're coming with a direct question. So did we have something run on the deployment that affected this table or this index? So this is to answer your question? Yes. Could be useful to have a list of things that change it. But I never found myself in the opposite situation where there was something unknown, something is broken, we don't know what is broken. And I had to figure out if migration were run as just about one of the many inputs to the investigation phase. It was more like something happened. There is an ongoing deployment, I provide the diff. And I would say that's it maybe that's not the case because oh, no, it just gets deeper and deeper. But it's kind of the entry point. So you provide context, you give the diff of things that were running more or less at that time, and then someone with a specific skill set may came back with questions like there were migrations. I mean, they have the diff, so they can find themselves. But that's kind of where the conversation evolved from there, right? Yeah. To expand on your first point, Alessio, it has happened to me that we actually executed a migration that caused a regular migration, that caused an outage because the code was not compatible with the database. Like production was expecting another column and Canary was serving them and then boom. And for that it was an S one. No one was very aware of what's causing it. And then it occurred me like, oh, this has happened before. It is like a miscompatible version. We need to find the migration and try to do something about it and then just restart the application. Regular migrations are also well, the problem was not the regular migration, the problem was the code not bit compatible. Yeah, but it started with the migration and didn't fail at the migration. So that's kind of the thing I was asking. Okay. Yeah. All right, so just to continue with this scenario, let's assume that the root cause was in fact a code change that was recently deployed and we were able to roll back. What will be the next steps here? I would engage with development to get someone working on a fix of some sort if we know that there is a code change. So the dev on call, dev escalation type thing, the reality is that yeah, I would also use my back end skill set to try to help. But I think from the release manager perspective, we should escalate to the Devon call and get development involved and then work with the other people involved in the incident, like the EOC, to determine whether or not we want to consider a rollback as a solution or if we want to roll forward and wait for a fix. In this scenario, we roll backed deployment, so the incident mitigated. So the question will be, like, what will we do next? To resolve the incident or to help resolve the incident? Got you. Yeah. If we did roll back, then we would need to halt deployments to prevent them from continuing and reapplying that problem and then again seek development to work on a fix. And then once the fix is done, we can pick it into auto deploy and then resume deployments with that deployment. Does anyone else have another answer? I'm going to take that silence as a no. So is that process documented, or do we know that from memory? I hope it's in the rollback run book. I'm pretty sure it is. That's quite a good runbook. Okay. Yeah. I know this from memory because it has happened many times, but I'm not sure It should be right. I think it is because I think the problem we generally face with rollbacks is that there's a misconception that as soon as we've rolled back, everything is resolved and everybody goes back to their lives. And I think the thing that we uniquely have to take care about is the fact that that doesn't mean the incident is resolved. We're still blocked. We still need a fix to be merged and deployed. So I think that's why we have I'm pretty sure we have it in that same runbook. I think we have it as, like, a follow up, like, what happens after a rollback, just like because your mileage actually may differ. It depends on the incident. It depends on what happened. But yeah, we have it. Okay. Also, yeah, it's briefly mentioned in the link I just sent it's the last sentence in that section. Following a rollback, the cause of the problem will still need to be fixed. Doesn't say anything about halting deployments, though. Yeah, as much as it mentions another merge request to fix it, I guess it's not very explicit about the fact that we need to halt deployments until that merge request gets picked and deployed. I think that process, at least for me personally, I remember it from memory. Okay. Could be a good one to follow up to see if we can clarify that process as much as possible, because it is a very common one. Who would like that action of open an mr and try and write it better? I was looking if it's in the s one incident procedure. Because if I remember, the rollback was kind of we had another runbook, which was about you have a totalaltage on what do you do? And rollback was part of that. And we kind of extracted and say, this is kind of rollback, because you may want to run rollback for exercise purposes and things like that. So maybe it's there. I was trying to find that link. Before we move on, does anyone else have anything to add for this scenario? I just wanted to mention for this scenario and actually also the first one, that a question which I think as release managers we should just get into the habit of always asking. It's not entirely our responsibility, but I think is a question that isn't asked often enough is, is this thing behind a feature flag? So we do quite often get kind of pulled into discussions can we roll back or does a revert get needed? And sometimes in amongst all of that we forget to ask the is this actually a feature flag that could be turned off? So I would suggest if ever you're asked any of these, just hopefully that's already been answered. But it's a good question to just ask. Anyway, this is in the Rom book that I was looking for. I was just reading from Scarbok. There is a remediation options and one of the point is consult the feature flag log and consider disabling any recently enabled features. Nice. I would follow up given everyone kind of agreed that they remember these things and didn't if it was in the runbook, if this situation came up, how often would you start searching Runbooks? Or how can we improve that habit? That is a good question. I normally do when I know that we have something in there that I don't particularly remember from memory and I go to the runbooks and search it. But searching in the runbooks is not the most friendly option. What I do is to actually go to my terminal and try to grab some keywords and then, oh, this is the page and then I open it on the web. It will be so much better if we have a search option like oh, rollbacks, just take me to that page. But yeah, it is a good habit to have. Yeah, I wanted to mention this as well. Can we add our like as a site, like Dedicated, they have a very just showing the MD files, markdown files. It's easy to search there from the UI more than actually our box because it's not like search friendly. I would say we did a test on this. Basically it means rewriting the whole repo because of links, because of syntax highlighting. So I did an attempt, I think six months, maybe one year ago. Well, it's a huge task, but yeah, I feel the pain. I have a trick of how I search them pretty quickly. I'll share it after and see if that's a helpful tip for anyone. For sure. Thanks, Steve. I have an annoying habit technique. You'll hate me for this, but I'm going to say anyway, which is quite often I know we have a book because I remember editing it. I'm like, I've read or written or reviewed something on this. So I would also strongly recommend frequently updating as many of these things as you possibly can, because you're like, I'm sure I've written something about QA or incidents or labels, and that's usually how I go and hunt the thing. I know it exists because I've definitely read or written in. Yeah, just a quick mention that. It. Is difficult to find the runbook. But for me, I just generally if I need to look for something, I go to the what's it called, the docs README. And we have a list, right, like that giant kind of like a bookmark list of things that we do as the release team. And generally things are there, but even now I look for a keyword, like incident and I get like two results and we have two different guides for even just there's a guide to incidents and then what to do in case of an incident. I think specifically for GitLab.com, but I feel like some of these could be a bit more consolidated because I think a lot of information is repeated. Yeah. Consolidate. Please, Jenny. I do exactly what you're doing and I'm like QA. Oh, there's four QA things. So, yeah, if you spot chances to cross link or consolidate or improve them, please do, because I think commonly someone can't find something and we just duplicate. So it's not a deliberate let's write this out lots of times. Ideally, it's just one. So, yeah, please improve them. I just added an action item for everyone to see. Like, if you see any consolidation improvements, just please take five minutes to do so because for sure it helps. So we have four minutes. I'm not sure if that is enough time to discuss the other points. So I think we should better wrap up so we don't risk to run over this meeting. So we have some action items. Who wants to take the first one about clarifying the steps after a rollback? I can do that. Awesome. Thank you, Jenny. And then Steve, just to share the release docs search tip and everyone to consolidate the release docs. And on these three minutes left, I'm going to ask you all the question. What do you think about this session? Do you see value of having these recurrent sessions each month? Awesome. Very happy to see a lot of head movement. Well, I have one more task, Myra, for you as a follow up action on this one, which you may have thought about already. But if we do want to make these reoccurring, which I think is a great idea, could you figure out maybe this is a fire drill section on the delivery handbook page or something that makes it discoverable so that people know where to look through previous ones or something? So if I want to know about Rollbacks. I can find this recording, and I know we did a fire drill and kind of reuse this information. For sure. I can do that. I will add it to the issue in which I am taking a lead on this. Thanks very much. Right. Does anyone else have anything to add in these last two minutes? I'm going to take that as I know so well. Thank you, everyone, for joining. And, well, I will see you around. Take care. Thank you for organizing. Thanks so much. Bye.",

        "transcript_text": "Rice is a crucial staple for over half of the world's population. And there might be a shortage that puts communities that need affordable rice on the precipice of cris. The only shortage out there right now. It's India's plain white long grain rice. It's cheap and lower quality that they ship to developing countries. Because rice is loved all over the world, it also continues to be manipulated commodity by governments in the world. India's export bans are reverberating through global rice know the protectionist measures basically send. A panic signal globally, the US has been dealing with India's oversubsidization. They've created this monster by subsidizing so much that now there's so many rice farmers that if they upset those farmers, that's a huge voting bloc. America's rice industry contributes over $34 billion to the economy. But US farmers face the same volatility. And you know our farmers, they'll go up against any rice farmer in the world, but they can't compete with a foreign government. Rice is a finicky crop, and the US produces about 20 billion pounds of it every year. Despite changing climates that are making it even more difficult to grow with rice. It's not just a question of enough water, but enough water at the right time. So it doesn't need to be a corn or a soybean to be incredibly important to the US agricultural economy. Here's how rice markets can threaten affordable food trade relationships and the livelihoods of millions of farmers. There are about 40,000 different varieties of rice, but the market is comprised mainly of long grain, medium grain, and short grain rices, as well as higher value rices like jasmine and basmati rice. Southeast Texas produce millions of bushels of rice yearly. People don't really think we grow rice in the US. First of all, it's a small crop, right? We're on 3 million acres as opposed to some of the other crops. It's a crop that makes use of a lot of land that other crops can't make use of. Most of the rice harvested in the US is eaten in the US, about 80% of iT. And also, if you think about your cereals like rice Krispies, Kellogg's with Texmex. Or Chinese food food service like chipotle. Rice is a key input into many products that we consume, but especially beer. Anheuser Busch is the number one user of U. S. Rice domestically. Rice requires unique growing conditions. It's a plant that's half submerged in pools of water, often on top of heavy clay soils that wouldn't effectively grow other crops. A lot of times when you think of a rice field, think of steps. A field maybe in India or maybe in Vietnam or Thailand. We don't have land like that, right? Our land is flat, but the farmers will grade it slightly so that the water can move from one end of the field to the other and they can capture it and recycle it. While the US is the largest rice exporter outside of Asia, the US only accounts for around 5% of global rice exports. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic and then the outbreak of the Russia Ukraine war caused global inflationary pressures. Some countries responded to the market shock with export bans. For an individual country, it makes sense to do export bans and help the more vulnerable parts of society. But if a lot of countries do that, and they are doing that now, it further pushes that price. Then one of the top rice producing countries limited exports. India. A country which exports make up 40% of the world's rice supply. Yeah. India is a larger rice exporter than the next four rice exporters in the world. In September 2022, India banned exports of broken rice and imposed a 20% duty on exports of some rice varieties. India is a country that has suffered from food insecurity in a significant way. There's an understandable desire to ensure appropriate availability of staple foods like rice within the country. But there's a tradeoff of that. You end up distorting the price signal for farmers. Rice prices spiked 15% to 20% by 2023. Rice prices hit their highest in almost twelve years. India added another export ban in July 2023 on its plain white long grain rice. It is concerning that we see the sharp rise in rice prices across the region. Part of the problem is that despite facing the same rising input costs for energy and fertilizer in comparison to other agricultural commodities, market prices for rice stayed relatively stable, which makes it harder for farmers to make ends meet. The equipment is expensive, the investment is expensive, and then you have all these outside factors really working against you. A lot of times people will picture bon pockettle in overalls with a pitchfork. They're not going to picture an $850,000 combine that's sitting out there, that's connected to satellites. India's rice export ban impacts developing countries that depend on its affordable rice. That adds to fears of global food insecurity if rice supplies are limited. It's impossible to think about rice without thinking about the food security lens. Over 42 countries depend on India for over 50% of their total rice imports. The only shortage out there right now would really be India's plain white, long grain rice that they ship to a lot of countries throughout Africa and Southeast Asia. They don't ship their best rice there. It's cheap and it's lower quality. And when they slap a ban in place, that impacted those developing countries the hardest. India has historically been the cheapest supplier of rice. Africa or Southeast Asia. They're going to buy from India because they've got a ton of rice, they can get it here fairly quickly. For example, Indian rice made up over 80% of the market share in a number of African countries. But even in places like Indonesia, which is one of the largest producer itself, it is still vulnerable because it still requires imports to satisfy domestic demand. India states that its export bans ensure ample food supplies domestically. However, at the same time, food inflation concerns are at the center of India's elections. From an economic standpoint, it does not make sense for them to keep this ban in place or to have ever put it in place in the first place. It's purely know Prime Minister Modi is running for reelection. He's seen consumers complaining about increased inflation and rice prices domestically. And what they're really doing is they're trying to secure enough rice in their domestic market that their prices will drop for consumers. India has stockpiles of rice in government storage and is harvesting one of the largest rice crops on record. The other risks that we see are, of course, rising temperatures, but specifically rising nighttime temperatures. Because rice likes this kind of warmer. Day and cooler night, the rice industry faces environmental threats that can lower yields or destroy crops entirely, making it harder for farms to make a profit. For example, water is crucial for rice production, but it can't be too much or too little. I think we've seen significant drought in California, causing in 2022 a 50% reduction in planted acres. And now that there's been more water availability this year, significant recovery, maybe 40% increases in yield estimated. And then, of course, you bring water and temperature together, and what do you get is moisture, and that can become a breeding ground for pest and disease or weeds and herbs and things that are already fairly challenging for rice producers. When US rice farms can't compete with global rice prices, the government may step in with additional financial safety nets, which is exactly what happened in 2022. The government passed the rice production program as a supplement. $250,000,000 in funding that was provided by Congress at the end of 2022 was to support rice farmers that grew rice only during the 2022 crop year as a way to offset some of the losses that resulted from the extreme increase in input costs that did not correspond with the increases in crop prices that the farmers received. USA rice is lobbying Congress to include an updated safety net program in the next farm bill. A relatively small investment from the US government goes a long way in keeping our prices stable, but also keeping us competitive on the world market. Rice farmers can already opt into USDA insurance programs like price loss coverage and agriculture risk coverage. These programs exist really just to stop these farmers from falling through the cracks, because that would be a huge disaster, not just for the communities, but for their food supply. The rice growing communities in the six states where it's primarily grown are built around the rice infrastructure. So the rice mills, the rice dryers employ people, the farms employ people. It's the entire supply chain. I mean, these are very important pillars of these rural communities. USA rice estimates that each rice farm adds $1 million on average to their local economies. Rice farmers and exporters, they're all going to suffer because of distorted prices. It's such a risky business. On the other side of a rice shortage, it looks like the market can bounce back. For the most part, rice prices could drop nearly 10% by 2024. And if that happens, global rice markets may even reach a surplus by 2025. And when they decide that they've had enough of the export ban after the election, or when they feel secure politically, they will end the export ban. And then that means that rice prices globally will tank. That will impact all of the countries that export rice again. A farmer in Louisiana told me he know, every year we take every bit of money that we're worth and a little more, and we put it in the ground and we hope we can come back in six months and harvest a crop and sell it at the market.",

        "transcript_text": "TV show Dallas. That's how it got. All I know about Dallas from Czech TV. I'm glad we got that on the recording. We were talking about Texas, of course. All right, there's not too much in here today. The Agenda doc, a few announcements. First one here is that there is a new thing called the Create Knowledge sharing sessions that are kicking up this Friday, which is tomorrow, except for Chisten, which is today. Paul Slaughter, the other one, will run the first session tomorrow at 03:00 P.m. UTC, and he will be diving into non machine learning AI algorithms. I put a bunch of links in here. The Slack announcement, the zoom link. It's also on the Create Stage calendar, which I discovered existed. So also, if you didn't know it existed, there it is. Yeah. So, yeah, feel free to attend. Sounds pretty exciting. I think I might join this. It's a good time for me. Second announcement here. We now have a team onboarding issue template. Thank you, Amy and Kai, for the reviews and moving this forward, because I was kind of lazy on this one, to be honest. I left it sitting around for too long. But it's merged now, so we have it. Also, it describes how to link your PTO to the team calendar. I put that in bold there. So please do this if you haven't already. It's very helpful so that we can see who is out when automatically the next thing kai, do you want to give a shout out? Yeah, I was just going to highlight the thing that is yours. So I'm not taking credit for this, but this is francois did an awesome deep dive into the metrics for the group. So we do have Malmetrics instrumented on API calls that all these things make back to the monolith. That's how we track this. So they have to talk to the monolith. But there's just some really good growth and really good insights here. So that's a testament to all the work we're doing and sort of how rapidly we're able to get people onto these new extensions that have never existed before, which is always, as Thomas will know from two and a half, three years ago, was the biggest challenge with Vs code is, like, finding users. So having a nice driving feature to do that has been it's cool to see how we can move the needle here. Nice. Sweet. Yeah. The only thing that bothers me about this is that we have to wait a full month to see the numbers. Like, I wish I wanted to just see them daily or monthly, I don't know. But just me. They're instrumented weekly, so we can do weekly charts. So you could get like week charts. But it's still dependent on I don't know, I don't want to get into nuance service. Ping is crazy. And so it still depends on when an instance, a self managed instance, actually decides to send us service ping, which happens at some random interval for every single one, and then arbitrary date ranges are calculated and it's very confusing. You could use the weekly ones. Sounds like we'll know what you with monthly. That sounds fine. Cool. Awesome. Any discussion items? Anything we should be discussing? Amy? Yes. I can either talk or type. This is just a point for discussion later. If it turns out I'm looking at you, Tomas, that it's a pain to have to merge all of the stuff that I do for Docs, because I know I can be a little bit of a fire hose at times. Let me know and I'll see about getting a second tech writer added as a maintainer so that I can pass docs only changes to them and spare you. Thanks, Amy. No, I don't want to be scared of the Docs reviewing A, especially when I write them. I want to see your improvements because they are usually fantastic and I learn a lot with everyone. Secondly, some of the technical details. Moving. A step here or there might break the how to, even though you are usually doing a great job at keeping it work still. But yeah, please ping me on these, especially for documentation that I introduced or touched recently. Okay, thanks. If it does become too much, I think that is one of the few projects I don't actually have maintainer rights to. I think I had it at one point and then it got taken away when we moved it, and I don't necessarily need it back. But if we do need to merge, then I'm happy to help take care of the dock ones too. Thank you. Not to break anything else, maybe. I. Won'T even go that far. The recent docs update. You could have self merged, Kai. If you had the right. It would have been fine. Maybe I rewrote the change log. Francois, looks like you got the next one. Yes, I just wanted to ask if there is any follow up discussion from the chat meeting today. I hopped off a bit early. Is there anything we want to discuss as a team as part of that, or no. I would like to know whether we want to dedicate ourselves to investigating the chat. Whether because I didn't hear the definite yes, we need your help here, we will switch to the language server. And because we are doing some investigation right now, there are some problems to solve. So the question is whether I need to work on it. Yeah, that's my question as well, because kind of what I raised in that meeting was like, okay, if you Lena, for example, work on this, then you're not working on chat. Basically, you're not working on the code suggestions anymore, which is technically what we should be focusing on. But of course it's like it's happy to collaborate and enable other teams, but for me, if we were to start try to make this work, I would try to do the smallest version possible, which doesn't do streaming at all. If that's not even supported right now in the current chat version, let's just do it without the streaming. That sounds like it's one of the most difficult part of it or that needs the most work. So if we could skip, it would be great. That won't give us a user experience that we are or they are aiming for. I guess we'll try to figure out the streaming thing and once it's figured out, it would be easier from there. Yeah. And I think from my side it's a yes. Like we should work on it just because it increases the value of the language server and moves it forward in a direction that we need to go anyways. Right. Like this is super important that we do this. So we do need to have some skin in the game. But I've also asked David to make sure they have some skin in the game too. So there's a transparently, there is a DM to Francois and David that says, yes, we should do this. I'm guessing Francois hasn't seen it yet, but David and I went back and forth a bit and think it makes sense. So we just need to align that. With I've not seen it yet. No. The issues that David said he would create after the meeting will align it and figure out how that works. But I think it makes sense for you to keep working on it given where things are with the language server and the work that Thomas and Tristan are doing. I think on sort of the code suggestion side, I think that does give you some capacity as the expert on the language server to help guide them and how to do this. Yeah, expert might be more than you want for this, but that's what sorry, we're adding it to your team profile and you'll forever be stuck. Okay. Yeah. Those are very sticky. Tend to be very sticky, these labels. I'm currently telemetry expert, for example, and I'm like, no, I want to stop doing that actually. I don't want to stop doing that. I really enjoy it. I'm going to stop anyway. That's the next point, actually. Oh no. Maybe thomas, you had another point for that. There are still some things that I haven't had a chance to look at today. I worked on automated releases of the language server, which is quite important, especially as more people start contributing code. We can't ask everyone to, at the end of their merge request to change the version and change look and everything to release it. This needs to happen automatically. I've done that today. But there is linting every time. We don't have a strict Linting on TypeScript and we let someone write a code in the project. We are introducing depth that we will be fixing later on when we want to introduce a strict linting and the contributed code doesn't match it, that's really important. If we let anyone else and let's say us three maintainers now, contribute code and having good examples of automated tests that are not just riddled with mocking and complexity would be also great for new contributors if we want them to write correct tests. So I think that there is some housekeeping that needs to happen before we say, tell another team, go wild and introduce your features to the project. Fair point. Yeah, that makes sense to me. And good, that sounds like you've already made some progress on one of those, so that's nice. Cool. The next point. Yeah. Thomas, you wanted to ask about the plan for telemetry. Handover to a brief context here. I so far have been the main person kind of driving telemetry, at least from a higher level perspective. Obviously, I'm not implementing anything but sort of making sure that it's actually working, what it actually looks like and all of that stuff. So that's been really fun because I enjoyed this. But also I fear now that I don't have that much time to do it and it's pretty critical stuff, so I probably shouldn't be doing this. So instead I'm asking John to take over as DRI for that entire topic. And basically what we have prepared this doc, which John and I have a call right after this actually to go through. We'll record it as well. So it's kind of like going to be a mix of brain dump and sort of Q A maybe, I guess sort of basically trying to make it like a like make it so that after that, john is positioned to actually effectively work on this thing. And as part of that, I would also expect that, John, you will end up working with a lot of the different extensions, the different people working on the extensions to figure out all this stuff. Yeah, there's probably a little onboarding that I'd love to do with Tomas and Lena, just a chat about, hey, what's the current implementation? I've looked at the code base enough to where I think I have a good grasp, but I'd like to get the people actually working in know, hey, here's what I've had to do, or, These are some gotchas why we had. To do it this way. So I'm sure I'll be setting up meetings if that's good with everybody. Yeah, that makes sense. And anyone is welcome to join that call. The next one of this, by the way, if you're interested and you want to just let me know. I can add you to the invite or you can look at my calendar and click the link there because it's just public it. Just to clarify scope, what John is taking on is sort of the like, is telemetry working correctly and can we report on it properly? Assuming Carolyn can model it and we can build charts. It's not that he's taking on, like did vs. Code call suggested, requested, suggested, rejected. Like the individual implementation of the events in each IDE. We assume that the extension people are responsible for that the events are implemented in the right spot. John's responsible for, like I'm getting the data and it all matches and it's correct and I trust. Yeah. I don't expect John to suddenly contribute to all four extensions in parallel and fix the telemetry everywhere, if that's what you are asking. I don't think that's reasonable, but I would expect, however, for, like, he might discover oh, shit. Actually on JetBrains right now, this thing is totally off, like this part of it, and we need to figure out why and then work with Ali or be like, hey, Ali, can you look into that, basically? So it's sort of what I've been doing. Except what John can do that I can't is actually do some of the work, for example, in Visual Studio or the Language Server, where I was just kind of and also he'd have? I think longer spans of focus on this thing where for me, it's been really spotty and so kind of difficult to keep longer threads going. I'm also fine if John decides he does want to contribute to all. Yeah. By the way, that's also expectations. If I see some quick wins, I'll definitely open up Mrs. Oh, yeah, even. I did this, by the way. And this is when I bragged about about the AI gateway. I got fixed telemetry on the AI gateway and thank you very you know, this is possible. It is doable. Yeah. We'll test John's polygon skills, see how good they really are. A battle later between John and Thomas once John's ramped everywhere and see who's got the most languages under their belt. Yeah. Can we generate some more of these what was it, this robot thing made of all the editors, something like that. For each of us? Yeah. Did we have a name for them? Yeah, we did. What was it? Was it the Power Rangers? I don't know. I think we didn't align. There were some suggestions. We need to schedule another meeting to talk about what we're going to call our. All right, yeah. Any other any other topics? No.",

        "transcript_text": "It. Between 2012 and 2021, there were 353,000 fires in homes across America, another 117,000 in other buildings, and hundreds of thousands of vehicle fires and fires outdoors. During that time, home fires alone caused nearly 3000 deaths, more than 11,000 injuries, and over $8 trillion in damage. There are roughly 27,000 fire departments across the country, with about 52,000 stations among them. In these station garages are estimated to be an array of about 200,000 firefighting trucks. A single fire truck can cost up to $2.5 million, and in the US, this company is the biggest maker of them. The Wisconsin based brand is a subsidiary of Oshkosh Corporation, a sort of superstore of purpose built vehicles. Need a news van, mail truck, garbage truck, construction lift? Oshkosh makes all of them. We serve people in our communities who are doing the toughest work, really hard work, dangerous work. Now the company is electrifying, but that comes as the company faces severe failures elsewhere. Defense makes up a quarter of its revenue, and the company recently lost a $9 billion contract that made up more. Than half of that. Probably makes sense for them to deemphasize defense because, quite frankly, the people who want to invest in electrification and decarbonization generally don't love defense businesses. You as the leading maker of the 28 companies that belong to the Fire Apparatus Manufacturers Association, Pierce has been making fire trucks since 1939. Its designs and innovations are largely responsible for the modern fire engine as we know it. The Chevron striping you see on the back of fire trucks was first featured in an early Pierce product. In 1958, the company made the first fire truck with an articulating boom called a Snorkel. The following year, sales topped $1 million for the first time. Over the decades, the company has made key innovations in every part of the vehicle. Now Pierce has made what it says is North America's first zero emission fire truck, no mean feat given the fact that large vehicles are considered the toughest to electrify due to the sheer size of the battery needed. What we're Addressing uniquely with the electric vehicle space with our solution, is it's a North American style fire apparatus that doesn't change the way in which the trucks operate, the way they're used, and largely the way they're serviced. Each fire truck is custom made, depending on the type. A single vehicle can take about eleven to 14 weeks to build from the time the factory first starts cutting sheet metal to the time it is ready for customer pickup. The total paint catalog numbers 987 different colors, including more than 300 shades of red. There is a multitude of custom chassis and a complex supply chain that can offer all kinds of options in drivetrains, axles, pumps, lighting systems and whatever else. Given that amount of variability, it does create a uniqueness to our business and how we have to operate, how we have to design, how we have to manufacture, as well as how we have to service those apparatus in the field. Oshkosh was founded by two entrepreneurs in 1917. They patented inventions for four wheel drive vehicles, but continuous rejection by automakers forced the two to go into business for themselves. More than 100 years later, Oshkosh Corporation still makes vehicles. A few key pieces of technology tie a lot of its various product lines together. For example, most of the products it sells make use of hydraulic lifts in one way or another, while serving about 20 different end markets makes the business more complex. It has advantages. The company can use the same piece of electrification technology on a postal vehicle that it uses on a construction lift. It can use autonomous tech on an airport vehicle or a garbage or recycling truck. Between 2002 and 2022, company sales grew from $1.7 billion to 8.3 billion. Its biggest customers are primarily municipal governments, but it also serves airports, the Department of Defense, large industrial companies, universities and international markets. We deal with so many various suppliers that we still stumble across those one offs. So we still muscle through those things. The strategies in which we're employing are things like dual sourcing. We're promoting those suppliers ourselves that actually have a consistent delivery schedule. We know which suppliers are going to create problems for us. We know which ones are going to help us. Despite high inflation and supply chain shortages resulting from the pandemic, the company is confident about its prospects. In 2022, it had a record order backlog worth $14.1 billion. It is expecting close to $10 billion in revenue in 2023. We've shown that we've gotten through the supply chain difficulties. The throughputs in our plants are much better. Our earnings this year, our current guidance is $8 per share. It was a tough situation, but we've proven we could get through it, and that'll continue. Oshkosh has four segments, the access equipment business, construction lifts and telescoping, forklifts and towing and recovering vehicles. It made up nearly half of net sales in 2022. Defense makes up the second biggest chunk of the business. And then there is the commercial segment, dump trucks, garbage trucks, cement mixers and others. At the same time, Oshkosh has suffered some setbacks. Most recently, it lost a $9 billion contract to make the next generation Joint light tactical vehicle, or JLTV, a kind of multipurpose military vehicle. The JLTV program comprised more than half of Oshkosh's annual defense revenues. Production is expected to end in 2024. We weren't willing to supply the contract at zero or negative margin. That's not the type of business that we run, and that's why we didn't win the contract. The US government is a shrinking portion of our revenue right now purely because presidential budgets are not appropriating as much money as they had been before to core tactical wheeled vehicles that the Department of Defense buys. Its defense programs have single digit operating margins, making them the least profitable portion of OshkosH's portfolio, and a reason why some investors think defense isn't worth holding on to anymore. The investors who value decarbonization and sustainability are looking for electric vehicle plays, but those are not generally the same people who want to make investments in defense businesses. You're working at cross purposes here, where you have something that sustainability investors really value highly paired with something that they actually try to avoid. The company says it plans on bidding on government contracts coming out of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022. These have boosted demand for the company's purpose built construction, lifts and other vehicles. That any new technology, especially in our space, you have your traditionalists and then you have your early adopters. We're going through that early adopter phase, but the demand is strong. The interest is high. Oshkosh is spreading electrification to areas of its portfolio beyond the Pierce brand and the postal delivery vehicles. One example is the electrified version of the striker, an airport rescue and firefighting vehicle. Nobody ever thought you could electrify an 80,000 pound vehicle. We've done it. We're taking orders for it right now all over the world. Offsetting some of the lost business in the defense sector is the contract the company won to produce the USPS next generation delivery vehicle. It is planning for a production ramp in the second half of 2024. The total contract is for up to 165,000 units. Any company trying to electrify will face the usual challenges, such as figuring out how their customers are going to charge. Construction sites, for example, tend not to have a lot of spare electricity supplies, so the company is developing mobile recharging equipment that can be brought to a work site. Pierce's Volterra Fire truck has a backup diesel engine but is designed to meet its daily duty cycle on electric power. We'Ve had multiple in service. We've had one in service for over two years in Madison, Wisconsin. That truck has gone on thousands of calls and the battery life has never been an issue. They've operated it under a full battery that entire two years, essentially with never dropping below 40%. There's a fair amount of their served end markets that are going to electrify over the next ten or 15 years. They're fairly well positioned to make that transition because they don't have a ton of really big global competitors. They're very niche end markets that they operate in. They tend to be the market leader in most of those. Those end markets electrify. I think these guys have an interesting opportunity to lead that charge. To the father.",

        "transcript_text": "America's big cities are facing major problems. From sky high interest rates to the reluctance of employees to return to their office. The impact of higher rates and the banking stress is hurting smaller businesses across the country, many of which can be summed up by a controversial new phrase, the urban doom loop. The environment is certainly shifting on Main street, and it's weighing on optimism. Losses at the bank level, right. There's going to be losses at the investors level. And I think for the cities, right. They're going to have this potential, this urban doom loop. Columbia Business School professor Stan Van Nureberg coined the term. Here's how it all works. Early in the pandemic, a lot of office sector workers started working from home. And here we are, three years later, many of them are still working from home at least some of the time. All of that has led to a large reduction in the demand for office. We see a lot of companies downsizing. We see a lot of companies not renewing their leases at all and consolidating. And with this demand decline for office comes declines in the revenues for the owners of those offices and value declines in these offices. Declines in property values reduce property tax revenues for the city. Because cities have to balance their budget, they now need to cut spending. That means less money for public safety, for sanitation, for transportation, for education, makes the city a less attractive place to live. People migrate out. Property values fall more. Less money, more people moving out. And the city gets into an urban doom loop where its fiscal health spirals down. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work policies prompted many employees to leave their city and move to new states. These population outflows have long term implications for cities, which rely on tax revenues for funding. Property tax revenue in New York City is about half of all tax revenue. Commercial property tax revenue is about 10% of all tax revenue. So if the value of that falls by 40%, wE're talking about a 4% hole in the budget. So if New York City's budget is $100 billion per year, that's a $4 billion shortfall that has to be made up somewhere else. Rich people pay a disproportionate share of income taxes. In New York, for example, a few thousand taxpayers are paying half of all taxes. Migration has become easier because you can leave the city without leaving your job. So if a few rich people or families leave, that could leave a large hole in the budget. Technology sector has been more permissive to remote work, and so those cities tend to be affected the most. Think of places like San Francisco, Seattle, West coast cities, sort of. More generally, the urban doom loop isn't just a theory, it's playing out in the real world, with landlords finding themselves financially underwater and regional banks facing a credit crunch. So when I'm a landlord and I want to buy a building, typically I'm going to buy it with a combination of my own money, my equity, and a piece of debt. Because real estate is such good collateral, banks are generally willing to lend a lot of money. So typically there will be 60, 65, sometimes even 75% debt and 25% equity. So that would be a typical financing structure for a commercial real estate building, and then typically the debt will be fixed rate. The only difference is I'm not paying off any principal, which means that ten years later, when my loan comes due, I need to refinance that loan. Now, normally that's not a problem, because normally the value of my office will have gone up in these past ten years. But what if it hasn't? What if the value of my office has in fact gone down? So now the bank will look at that office all over again and reassess it. And to the extent it's even willing to give me a new loan, it's going to only want to give me a smaller loan. So now as a landlord, I'm going to have to make a tough choice. Either I come out of pocket and put more money into the deal, because the loan that I'm getting now is smaller than the one I need to repay from Ten years ago, so I put in more equity in the deal or I walk away. And I have the right to do that. I can send the keys to the lender and just walk. A lot of the debt is non recourse, which means the bank has no recourse to my other assets. I can just simply take this one office building that I've borrowed against and just send the keys to the bank. And the bank now owns the building. So banks are facing this deterioration in basically the credit quality on these commercial mortgages that they have on their books. So these smaller regional banks that have done a lot of local commercial real estate lending, they're now tightening the screws on the credit for the local non real estate firms as well. That is sort of a traditional credit crunch. Commercial real estate is a very large asset class. There's about $5 trillion of commercial real estate out there. And whether you know it or not, your pension fund might very well have an exposure to commercial real estate directly or indirectly. There's also a part of the equity market called the REITs Market, which is the publicly listed real estate space. And again, a lot of folks have exposure to that through a mutual fund, through an exchange traded fund. And those REITs, especially the office REITs, have fallen on hard times in the last several years. Their stocks are often down 50, 60, 70%, sometimes occupancy of office, getting to. 30% below pre pandemic levels. The office sector certainly is going to experience more pain than any other sector in the next two to four years. With only a small percent of desks occupied around the world five days a week, and trillions of dollars of commercial and office debt about to come due in the next couple of years, it really makes you wonder how it's all going to shake out. So are we really doomed, or is there a way for cities to pull themselves out of the loop? The fundamental problem is that we have too much office. The only solution in the long run is to get rid of some of the excess office we have and repurpose some of that space. The solution you hear about the most is apartments. Turns out that that's easier said than done because a lot of our large offices are very big buildings. By my own calculations, only about 10% of office buildings are physically suitable for conversion to apartments. But that's just one of the options. You could think about more medical office space, you could think about more entertainment spaces, more hotel space. There's a lot of creative things we could do with the land. This is nothing new. Cities have always reinvented themselves throughout the ages, and it's now basically our next challenge is to get rid of some of that defunct office space. You it's.",

        "transcript_text": "My name is Blake Resnick. I'm the founder and CEO of Brink Drones. We basically build public safety technology. Brink Drones recently signed a deal to send several drones to the New York City Police Department. Drones aren't anything new to the New York City Police Department, but their use has only increased as the technology has become more ubiquitous. We want to utilize this technology to complement our crisis management team, complement our police personnel, and respond appropriately and be able to respond in record time. A drone could get to a location in 30, 40 seconds where we're going to have crowded streets, where police are not going to be able to get there as fast. This is Lemur Two. This is sort of our main in market drone right now. It's designed to get first responders eyes and ears in dangerous places. First drone in the world to have a glass breaking capability. It can literally fly out to a window, shower it out, enter a structure that's really unique. First drone in the world to have a two way audio system so you can actually put on. Crisis negotiators use this sort of like a flying cell phone, deescalate a situation. I mean, the reason I got interested in this space at all was the October 1 shooting happening in my hometown. In the late hours of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a crowd in Las Vegas from a hotel window. This became the deadliest mass shooting in US history. The gunman was found dead before midnight. But the response to the aftermath of the shooting carried on into the early hours of October 2. I got a phone call from my best friend when October 1 started, who was on the Strip and started hearing gunshots. And he asked me where I was. I luckily wasn't there, but I knew other people that were. It got me initially thinking that first responders need better tools. It took officers an hour and five minutes to make entry into the room where the gunman was firing from during October 1. The reason why that happened is, all over the Strip, plain clothed police and security took out their service weapons, and then they were misidentified as additional active shooters. So what first responders are thinking when this is happening is this is a coordinated terror attack at these six or seven different sites. They're sending resources to all of these places incorrectly. They don't understand the true nature of the event, and it just took a lot of time to actually understand what was going on. I think the right drone system, something that could take off from a fire station a half a mile away from the Mandalay Bay, and there is one right there that could have arrived in 45 seconds and just given that aerial perspective to tell them that this is a lone gunman halfway up the Mandalay Bay shooting into the Route 91 Harvest Festival. That is information that would have saved lives. That's what we want to build two missions that we've done that I'm really proud of. First, in Surfside, Florida, we got a call. So the situation there is there was a 14 story building. Half of it initially collapsed. There were around 100 missing people. We got on scene less than 24 hours later, took off our drone, and we were able to search that underground section of the building basically with a structural engineer in a virtual reality headset, watching the video output of one of these things. We dealt with some similar situations in Turkey. And what we found was there were also families outside of these things that maybe lost a family member somewhere inside. And they were waiting for first responders to come in, either to find a surviving family member or to tell them that they didn't make it. We were able to launch our drone and in some cases actually use the glass breaker attachment on our bird to bust out a window, make entry, fly around clear rooms and try to find folks. Ukraine is our largest drone operator. They have around 60 of our systems, almost all of which are in the hands of Ukrainian emergency services. So it's sort of their female equivalent. They're using our drones to search partially collapsed buildings, structures that might have been hit by cruise missiles or artillery. That's sort of the niche we fall into. Some groups are concerned with the privacy problems when it comes to drone use. We have to push back on the Sci-Fi aspects of drones. No one is going to be up monitoring what you're talking about. Your conversation. Recently, New York City announced that they would use drones to monitor parties on Labor Day, drawing a backlash amongst some observers. There are a number of calls of loud music, disruptive behavior. Instead of the police having to respond and look at those, they're going to utilize drones from a safe distance, up, not down, flying in someone's backyard to see what they have on a grill. They're going to utilize the drones to determine should they send crisis management teams there right away to help mitigate the problem. We don't want police to be the same, the only responsive. I think for our current products, indoor SWAT drones, there aren't huge privacy concerns just because these are critical incidents. Every officer is already wearing a body camera. In the past, they would actually put up police helicopters to get an aerial perspective. These are really intensely surveilled situations, but they're surveilled because they're incredibly dangerous. Right. There's usually someone armed with a rifle inside of one of these houses. And if they poke their head out of a window, police kind of have to know that. So we're just one more camera on top of dozens that are already deployed. I don't think there are huge privacy concerns around that use case. I think where these questions start becoming a lot more interesting is when we're installing these big citywide networks of nine one response drones. You just have to be really thoughtful when you're designing these systems. One really good strategy in general is to not have cameras on or to have cameras pointed just at a horizon when a drone is taking off from a fire station and en route to a 911 call, for example. I think another similar example is really only using drones to respond to active emergencies. And when someone calls for help, sending a drone to respond to a 911 call as opposed to just launching and accomplishing surveillance.",

        "transcript_text": "There's no question that Bob Iger enjoys being the CEO of Disney. Bob Iger has a stellar track record as CEO, at least up until recently. For about 15 years. In his first run as Disney's CEO from 2005 to 2020, Disney shares rose about 425%. That far outpaced the S and P 500. In many ways, he is the standard, the pinnacle of American CEO. He has really struggled with the issue of succession, did finally step down as CEO in 2020 and handed the reins over to Bob Chapek, and that did not go well. Bob Chapek was Bob Iger's handpicked successor. And when Bob Iger initially picked Chapek, these two men had worked together for more than 20 years and had never had a disagreement, I was told. So on paper, it kind of seemed like this would work. Bob Iger would be the chairman, Bob Chapek would be the CEO, and these two men would work hand in hand. Then, just weeks after the announcement, the pandemic hits the United States. The Disney parks are shut down. And there's an April New York Times article where without telling Bob Chapek, Bob Iger emails the reporter and says, look, given the nature of this crisis, you could only imagine that I would come back into a more hands on operational role and run this company. Given the fact I've been running it for the last 15 years fairly well. That really irritates Bob Chapek, and I think that catches Bob Iger off guard. Bob Chapek calls Bob Iger and kind of lays into know Iger feels like he's kind of never been spoken to this way, at least in a corporate environment, before. The relationship doesn't really heal from that point on. So Bob Iger has told people privately that the damage done from the Bob Chapek regime has been the main thing that he has tried to undo for the last nine months or so that he's been on the job. In Iger's mind, Chapek did enormous damage to the Disney culture, the Disney brand, Disney as an investment. Various decisions, such as reorganizing the company and his stance with the don't say gay legislation in Florida. The Bob Chapek defense would argue that he had a mission, and his mission was to transition Disney into a modern media company. He reorganized the company around streaming around Disney, plus around Hulu. At this point, I would say that strategy is very much in doubt. Disney is struggling right now, and I don't think all of that can be blamed on Bob Chapek. And in fact, even in the nine months since Bob Iger has returned. I can't really point to any particular one of those areas where I could say, oh, yeah, Disney is stronger today than it was even a year ago. In fact, I would argue that Disney's probably weaker today. There are weaknesses throughout Disney's media businesses. Whether you look at the linear TV. Business, we're talking, I guess, ABC, the network, the stations, but then the cable networks as well. Yes, correct. FX, NatGeo. Is it possible you would look to sell them? We're going to be expensive, I think, if you can interpret what that word means. We're just getting at that work. But we have to be open minded and objective about the future of those businesses. Yes. Meaning that they're not core to Disney. That they may not be core to Disney. Yeah. Now there's clearly creativity and content that they create that is core to Disney. But the distribution model, the business model that forms the underpinning of that business and that has delivered great profits over. The years is definitely broken on the movie side. It just has not had the same level of hits from Star Wars. The last big Star wars movie was a few years ago. Now, Pixar used to be just this dominant giant, even Marvel, which had been this juggernaut. It has been much more stale in recent years than what it was a few years ago. The one asset that has long been a crown jewel for Disney is ESPN. And that too falls back into the bucket of linear TV networks, losing subscribers as more and more Americans cancel cable TV every year. Now, Iger has talked publicly about finding strategic partners for ESPN. I'm told a full spinoff of ESPN is still on the table. If they can't find any partners, if. They come to the table with value that enables ESPN to make a transition to direct to consumer offering, then we're going to be very open minded about that. One by one, in all these media assets, there's trouble brewing, and Iger is going to have to figure out a way out.",
        "summary_success": "Bob Iger was a successful Disney CEO from 2005-2020 but struggled with succession planning. He chose internal candidate Bob Chapek as his successor but their relationship soured after Chapek was irritated that Iger said he'd take a more hands-on role during the pandemic without telling Chapek first. Iger has since returned as CEO and thinks Chapek damaged the Disney brand and culture. Disney is now struggling across its media businesses - its movie studio has not produced as many hits recently, cable networks like ESPN are losing subscribers as people cut the cord, and linear TV networks face declining viewership. Iger is considering finding strategic partners or even fully spinning off ESPN if its business model continues to decline. He acknowledges Disney may have to be open-minded about divesting certain non-core media assets.",

        "transcript_text": "Factors. Here at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, American Airlines prepares up to 15,000 meals a day now, with the help of robots for more than 800 flights daily. The airline just built this 214,000 square foot facility that features more automation to keep up with demand and to minimize catering delays as the number of people traveling breaks new records. And globally, demand is expected to double by 2040. We have some of the highest load factors we've ever had in the history of American. And so we wanted to build the next generation of catering facility that would grow with us. Food service on domestic airlines has drastically changed in recent years. Airplane food is known for being horrible, but airlines do carry a lot of people and they carry them around the world on sometimes flights that can top 812, sometimes 14 hours, and those passengers have to eat. Nearly 3 million passengers fly every day in the US. Post pandemic, airlines have seen an increase in passengers buying up to premium seats, putting pressure on airlines to offer better food options and more of them. The airlines want to have ways of getting business travelers to reject flying. Economy and demand. First class airlines do not disclose publicly how much they make from selling food is considered ancillary revenue, which are services not included in the base fare, like baggage fees, priority boarding and seat upgrades. Globally, airline ancillary revenue has grown from $42.6 billion in 2013 to nearly 103,000,000,000 in 2022. Running an airline is very expensive. So airlines like American, like Delta, they're going to look for places that they can cut costs wherever they can. Whether it's getting meals to an aircraft faster, whether it's making those meals more cheaply, they are going to do that. CNBC flew to Texas to get a first look at American Airlines. New facility has evolved a lot over the history of commercial aviation. During the 1950s, airlines served elaborate meals. But as flying grew in popularity, jets got bigger. Airlines added more seats and serving food became more complicated. Making airline food is difficult. If you think about how hard it is to cook for ten people. Imagine cooking for 200 people or 300 people at once. The airlines used to all have their own flight kitchens. And during that time, you had an actual high level of diversity in airline food because of the fact you got this very fast response at hey, the passengers don't like this. And there was an immediate, okay, we'll change to something else. Nowadays, airlines generally partner with catering companies. LSG Sky Chefs is one of the biggest, with 26% of total industry revenue in the US. One of the reasons airlines have cut back on food are for certain shock events 911 when airlines were kind of careening toward bankruptcy, travel demand dried up. Food was a very easy way for airlines to cut costs. Airlines eventually brought meals back and many started charging for food in economy class. It's yet another common add on item we see today. On top of baggage fees and seat upgrades. One of the numbers that you will never find that the airlines keep very, very secret is the amount that they pay their airline caterers for each meal. The actual cost. They make a spectacular profit on the meals that they sell. If they're selling you one of those lunch boxes for $5 $10, just think of what the actual costs are. They are trivial. International flights are a different story. Coach class passengers on a lot of those long haul flights are getting hot meals. But the first class meals are so much better. They're far more elaborate. They're multiple courses. And it's because those passengers are buying tickets that are 5000 6000, sometimes topping $10,000. During the COVID-19 pandemic, meals were one of the first services to be cut. Airlines have brought back much of that service and what we're seeing today is that consumers are more willing to spend when it comes to air travel. They want not just a better seat, but better technology in the seat. Better screens, better entertainment options, better WiFi and dining is also part of that experience. The amount of people flying and expected growth in air travel has led American Airlines to build its own kitchen in Dallas. To keep up with demand, we are. In our new state of the art kitchen. This is the largest catering facility in the United States. Prior to this new facility, American's food was prepared in another building alongside other airlines. What we like about owning the kitchen is ultimately we have flexibility as our business needs change. Currently, we have contracted out with LSG Sky Chefs to be our exclusive provider in the kitchen for the foreseeable future. Dallas Fort Worth International is American's world headquarters. The new facility makes meals for flights to Asia, South America, Europe and domestic routes. We tailor our offerings based on where our customers are traveling to. The one constant is our customer preferences change. What they may have enjoyed last year isn't necessarily what they're going to enjoy tomorrow. So we continue to modify our in flight dining and our footprint and what we actually make in the kitchen based. On that feedback, American invested $100 million building this facility and is replacing some tasks with automation to speed up production. Like this machine that packs trays of drinks which can reach up to 200,000 cans a day. It could even sort bad cans from good ones a task that used to be done by people. When a plane lands, trucks and workers arrive and remove all the galley carts. They're emptied, cleaned and restocked and get prepared to be sent out to another flight. It allows us the ability to make the food fresh, prepare it fresh, store it really quickly in temperature controlled areas, and then almost immediately put on the aircraft. So from the time of production to when our customers are enjoying, it can be as short as 2 hours and maybe a little bit longer in different circumstances. First and business class meals are made fresh in a kitchen, packed on a tray and refrigerated until they're reheated in flight. Other items, like snack boxes, are prepared here too. In a temperature controlled room, the staff uses pictures to set each tray. As menus change over the course of the year and from route to route. Airlines are under pressure to also provide more authentic dining. Sometimes they'll cater the plane based on the destination. And it is a very complex thing. Menu fatigue is something that's very real in this industry, and so we're constantly striving to mix things up. In the very near future, we'll be using artificial intelligence to actually take photographs of our food as it comes back from the aircraft. This will help inform menu design in the future. The airlines use catering facilities around the world, but this is the first building American has built from the ground up. There are more than 1000 LSG Skyshef employees who work here. A fleet of over 100 trucks go back and forth from the facility to each aircraft every day to ensure planes can leave on time. It really doesn't matter what you serve. The number one outlier that is important to our customers is running an on time operation. The demand for food will certainly continue to grow as more and more people will be traveling over the next several decades. But the bigger challenge may be more about the negative stigma about the food itself. The technology of cooking in flight is always going to be convection ovens. It is a moist style of cooking. You are steaming it. Americans love fried food. Why don't you give us fried food? Imagine working a deep fryer aboard an aircraft. No, don't. It's a terrible idea. The airline's ability to cater to our sense of flavor has changed because we not only know more about the technology of food, we know more about the physiology of us. The airlines are getting better at finding things that will work. Airlines will continue to use food to draw in customers as they fight to incentivize their airlines products and hopefully get them to pay more. Sometimes the coach passengers could even get a literal whiff of the food that the first class passengers are being served. Kind of the smell of freshly baked cookies, which is kind of like a trope of the class divide within an airplane that's been going on for a long time, but you can actually kind of see how much better the passengers are being fed just a few inches away from you, close.",

        "transcript_text": "You. Okay. It's Monday, March 1. This is the Inbound Marketing Leads call and we're going through our weekly agenda here. So we have some housekeeping. So I'm leading this meeting. Danielle's out, so she's here, but she's out and she's here. It's a magic trick. I just have a quick FYI that I experimented last week was shifting my schedule, being on Pacific Time Forward ahead 1 hour and it worked really well. So I'm going to stick with that. Just made it cool so I can engage with all the 08:00 A.m. Like group conversations and there's just so much cool stuff that happens at 08:00 a.m. My time. So it was great. So I just thought I'd give you a heads up. We don't have anything under the discretionary bonus. Does anyone have any thoughts on that? We haven't done one for a while, so let's set that as a goal maybe for this month that we really put our heads around the people that are helping us and show some appreciation for that. Becky has added two items for review, so the Marketing Manager's issue Board and the Sprint Doc. And I know she hit me up on Slack and I know she did some work over the weekend getting everybody's stuff organized. So with her not here, let's just review that individually and get used to using that Sprint doc. I know she added a couple notes, one for the DevOps platform messaging implementation. I've connected with my team too on that and we'll keep seeing how this goes. I was having a thought about this, about some of the conversation from Slack Bree that you mentioned that maybe this won't work for all teams. I don't think we need to force every single team to use this. We should be using the tools that are right and having some form of single source of truth in terms of this for my team, it does work. And I was talking to Becky this morning about we could potentially review this every other week in this meeting. And the week that review it is the week before Sprint planning. So we have an opportunity to say like, oh, there's actually these things that are related that are pretty important. Let's document them here so the teams who are related have a note of that so we can provide guidance while they're planning their Sprint without dictating exactly what they're going to do. Can I ask you a question about this? Just there's a type form quiz that's added in here. I was thinking maybe we could use this as a way for if we know of things that are prioritized on our side that are dependent upon the Web team, we could add that in there so that you're aware of it. So we're not just consistently pushing issues back, but making you aware that for whatever reason specifically go to market, that these are priorities for us, but the dependency lays on your side. So the type form quiz is one of the examples that I would use to maybe ping that in this doc. So that you're made aware of that. Yeah, that's the whole point. That's the whole point of Sprint planning. And I think what that's going to my hope anyway is what that leads to is an understanding of communicating the size of ask and the scope, because I think that's one thing that falls down. People feel a delay from our team, but what it is, is the ask is actually bigger than people realize when we get into it. So I foresee that this is a great first step towards us doing that and then we might even find a way where amongst this time it's like, oh, we need to talk a couple of sprints ahead to even make sure that when it does flow through properly, it's all broken down and going to work. So I love it. I think this is heading in the right direction. It's a great idea. Okay, so reading through the one to two goals. So since we are recording, how about we just do a quick let's just verbalize what we wrote. Erica, you're first here. Of course I'm first. I'm like, wait, I'm into another document. Writing something else about digital experience. But yeah, I'm really excited for this sprint. I think it's going to be great. So I was writing about how great that is for our team. We're going to be wrapping up things for the demo in terms of contracting, picking our last contractors. We've got two companies finalized for sure that we really like. We're going to be moving that forward tomorrow, so if they agree, then we're good and working on pre production. And then the other thing is just reorganizing boards workflows and such for the digital production team. Those are the highest level things we'll be working on this week and next would be Brie. So, yeah, getting content translated for the French page. I need to get reviewers on board for this page. I think we have one, I think we need two. I also need to review the messaging changes, make sure that the blog for the open DevOps is all set and taken care of, and update the existing case studies that I've written that just need like, edits. I'm also in the process of adding two logos from the customer reference team to the grid. And Danielle, should I read this or this note is necessary to discuss? No, it's good. That was more FYI for you. Okay, thank you. Who's next? Sorry. Michael. That's me. So, yeah, kind of related to your point too, Brie. I'm going to work with someone on my team to identify the top ten and the top 25 pages based on we're going to identify the criteria to identify those pages. Some of it's pretty obvious views where it ranks in the conversion path, et cetera. But we want to get ready to adjust the open DevOps platform messaging. We'll have that in an Mr not connected to any of the other work. So that if we decide not to go forward with that that's just work. We don't have to greenlight and then I'm going to meet with every not every member. I appointed four members of my team delegated as Dris on some OKRs so I'm going to connect with them and provide some coaching to keep those moving along. Shane. Thanks, Michael. Had to pull up the mute button there. Yeah. So I am working through some issues like triaging issues and just working through that with my team and then transitioning some things to them and then also focus on pushing forward, setting up GCP resources for marketing so we can set up server side tagging and that'll be dedicated to the marketing team. So for bigger context here we have a BigQuery instance that is connected to Google Analytics and that's in Google cloud platform. And when we initially set that up, I tried to go through engineering and then I think it said, no, we want that to go to marketing as a Cost center. And then so now what we need is we need a GCP server set up so that we can set up server side tagging and then use that to trigger events based on what that server receives. And so this is kind of the first step of getting that test going and working with our partner empirical path to move that forward. Brie when your cat started walking across your camera, I thought that was like a leg in the air. I didn't know but it was kind of tripping me so that would have been impressive. Yeah. Morning yoga. So yeah, that's what I'm working on this focus on this week and then next up we have discussion topics. Great. We've got three minutes time check as well so Becky's not on as a reminder to go through the pages and blog for the open DevOps messaging, I just want to connect with Becky on my question and point know ready to launch. Does that mean there's a chance that we to I think the easy answer here for us is just to create Mrs and branches that allow us to not have that interfere with what we released. But I just want to get clarity on that and that's everything we have in discussion topics. So if there's nothing else I'm going to click stop on record just some cat pats and we'll stop here.",

        "transcript_text": "Next up, I have the pleasure of introducing you to an expert in the workspace industry, Ryan Anderson, who is the Vice President of Global Research and Insights at Herman Miller. Much of Ryan's work has centered on how technological and social changes have enabled ways of working and living and how the places that we inhabit can support positive, productive experiences. So how does that translate at home? We know that a comfortable, intentional workspace can make a huge difference in productivity as well as your physical and mental well being. Ryan's going to share with us how individuals and organizations can adapt existing environments, whether it's a small city apartment shared with friends or a large single family home in the suburbs, so that you can live your best work from anywhere life. Hey everyone. I'm Ryan Anderson, Vice President of Global Research and Insights at Herma Miller, and I'm thrilled to be able to spend some time with you today talking about creating great home workspaces. If you don't know Herma Miller, we're primarily known for the furniture we make for homes, offices, hospitals, schools, gaming environments, and beyond. We love talking about how great design can impact people's lives, and today we're going to dive into that as it pertains to home workspaces. By the way, I am active in the chat right now, so if you have questions or thoughts as we go through, feel free to ask. I'll be happy to help. Our goal for the day is pretty straightforward. We're going to try to talk about how the design of home workspaces can improve productivity, health, and just our general experiences, our enjoyment of these spaces over time. I'll be drawing upon over 60 years of research into future of work and workplace, including home workplace. In fact, we released our first work from Home product all the way back in 1941, so we've been thinking about this for a while. I'll also include several statistics, specifically from a tool that we created to help people have better experiences working from home, which I'll tell you about later. About 20,000 people have used that tool. So the statistics you see will be drawn from that data. And ultimately, I want to provide you with frameworks and tips. Yes, some do's and don't do's as far as the design of home workspace. But more importantly, I want to be able to zoom out and talk about, at a bigger level, what really makes an effective, good, positive work from home experience or not, so that you're equipped not just to think about the design of specific parts of the space, but to really improve that experience overall. So we'll start with this framework, which is people process, place. This is the way we do our research at Herman Miller. We don't start with the spaces. It's tempting to at times, particularly when you make and sell furniture, but you really can't get the spaces right until you ask who's using them and what are they doing. And so that's where I want to start with us today, your home workspace. Or maybe this is for your employees. I know some of you might be tuning in to think specifically about your own space. Others might be representing an organization thinking about your employees space. In either case, just know that home workspaces are often not just used by one person. 54% of the people that have used our Work from Home tool have said yes, the spaces are dedicated for individual use, but 46% are shared. And we tend to see those percentage of shared even higher in big cities and outside of North America. And so give some thought to your own situation. Are you the only person using the space, or is your spouse or partner potentially going to be doing work or other activities from here? Might you be sharing it with older people or younger people? Multigenerational households were at an all time high since World War II, even before the Pandemic, but we saw them increase in 2020 and the evidence suggests that they're still increasing in 2021. So even if it's primarily you using this space for work, it might be that you've got a child who's using it for homework or an older person in your household connecting on video with friends or family. Think through that as holistically as you can and try to think about the differences in abilities physical, cognitive, sensory abilities, activities and preferences, because it'll make a difference. The way that we'll approach designing the space might be different, even the objects. Does it make sense to have a chair that has more manual adjustments that can be really fine tuned for one person? Or does it make sense to have a chair that doesn't require many adjustments so that it's easily shared between people and so that the person who uses it the most doesn't come back and say, oh, somebody adjusted my chair every single time. So these are just some of those factors. So think about the users, both now and in the future, who might be using this space next week or next year. Then, once you've given some thought to the who, now let's start thinking about the various activities, what people are actually doing. And I'd really encourage you, if you've never done this, to try to catalog what you do in the course of a week. You can go back and look at your calendar, or you can just grab a notebook and start writing some things down. Because the better you get at understanding the full breadth of activities that you do, the more you'll be able to determine whether or not your home workspace really does or does not support it. Because in a more traditional office environment or a hybrid situation, we can rely on corporate offices to cover off on some of these activities. But when it's work from home as a full time remote or remote first approach, we need these home workspaces to cover off on as many important activities as possible so that we don't find ourselves saying, oh, I just have a really tough time doing this. So I put a few words on this slide. Process work, email, expense reports, learning, training, concentrative, creative work. Do you have a place where you can be in PowerPoint or a spreadsheet for a couple of hours at a time? How about contemplation or deep thinking? When you're not using any tools, you just have to think through something. Video presentations, different types of communications, synchronous, asynchronous, but also even beyond work. Is this a space where you might want to use it for gaming? Or use it to watch some TV or some streaming media? I should say it wouldn't actually be a TV, but I'm a parent of some teenagers. Sometimes I lose control over the TVs in our house. And I've been known to come to this workspace and use it to stream some content just for enjoyment. By the way, I'm going to talk to you a little bit about my own home workspace too, just as an example of some of how I approach this, just because it can be a little bit more relatable. But give some thought. What are the full breadth of activities that you really need to make sure that you've got covered? Or else you're going to find that your productivity suffers as a result. And then as we turn our attention to place, think through the various places within your home where some of these activities can happen. There will be a primary space, probably with a desk and a desk chair. But that's not the only space that some of these can happen. Maybe some things want to happen from your dining room table or your kitchen. We don't want to see you spending hours and hours in a place that's not ergonomic or comfortable. But there might be some activities. Like I've got a phone call, just an old fashioned audio phone call that I decide I'm going to take from the back porch. It's good to think of this as a continuum of spaces within your home. Even if you're in a real small apartment in a big city, chances are you'll have a primary but also a few secondary spaces. And you can then begin to ask the question what activities can happen? Where and what should the primary workspace really focus on? I'll tell you, in terms of my work life, I love working outdoors. I spend time working on my back porch a lot. I might take an audio call from my sofa in the middle of the day just to kick back. I spend most mornings starting out in a very consistent way. I get up, have a cup of coffee, sit on the back porch, think about what I want to get done in the course of the day, and then I take my dog for a 45 minutes brisk walk. During those walks, I might use it to think about what I'm going to say during a presentation, or think about a conversation I need to have with someone, or even listen to a podcast so I can learn. So in my mind, I think about all these spaces, even the sidewalks around my neighborhood, as places where some of these critical activities occur. And the more you think about it, the more you can make sure that your primary workplace and your secondary within your space is designed to support those activities we talked about before. Now let's turn our attention to the actual design of the spaces. How do you begin to go about thinking about creating this space? Well, I'll give you another framework, not surprisingly, which is think about the surroundings, the furnishings, and the tools. I know we're a furniture company, and of course I'm going to talk to you about furniture. But it isn't just the furniture like in that image. The surroundings here include these beautiful exterior windows. The furnishings include chair and a table. The tools can include not only digital, but analog things books, pens, anything you need to accomplish your work. And when you think about these holistically, it's the best way to create spaces that really work together. So let's focus a little bit on those surroundings. 52% of the people who have used our Work From Home tool say they have some sort of dedicated space, dedicated room or space that can be closed off from the rest of their environment to do their work. 48% don't have that. Now, as I dig into the data a little bit more, not surprisingly, it's more suburban and rural locations and countries with larger homes where we find that to be the case, like the US, Canada, Australia, you get into spaces that are maybe smaller architecturally, or you have less likely or less likely to have a spare room. Places like India, mainland China, a whole host of other areas. Then you're going to have to work with different constraints. And it is possible to think through the surroundings, even as taking basically a portion of what is essentially a larger shared area that may be used for living or dining other things, and still create a great work from home experience. Begin by thinking about boundary. Boundary can mean a number of things. It can mean walls, but it can also mean screens, foldable, modular screens that include curtains, anything that provides you some privacy, some visual privacy, or that can act as a backdrop. And backdrops are important for those of us that spend a lot of our time on video, including me. You can see in this picture, as well as in my own home workspace, the desk is pulled away from a wall so that the video camera is pointed at essentially what is a controlled environment behind me. I think most of us remember that BBC video that went viral with that guy being interviewed and his kids bust in the room behind him and all this chaos. Hey, that's home life, right? We've got kids and pets and all sorts of other stuff going on. I think it's best to keep the chaos in front of us. So having something with some opacity, something like a wall or a screen or a curtain behind us makes a ton of sense to try to make sure that our views are protected. So those are some of the considerations with boundary. But it's not just boundary. It's other things related to our surrounding as well. Lighting critically important. If you get some natural light, that's wonderful. It's great for the body and the soul, but make sure that it's not hitting your screen and creating glare. Maybe have it coming in in front of you as opposed to behind you. If you don't have access to natural light. There are still some ways of using great artificial lighting that you can think through beyond just throwing in a normal light bulb. In this particular home office I'm in, I've installed an additional pendant light above my desk. I've used a light bulb that actually can be changed to change the color temperature. There's something known as circadian cycle. I'm getting real geeky research on you here. Sorry about that. But basically the sun in the morning is more intense with cool temperatures, and in the afternoon it's less intense with warmer temperatures. You can even replicate that with light bulbs inside your house. So think about the lighting, whether it's artificial or natural, and then maybe even think about some additional natural elements. There's kind of a school of design known as biophilic design. It's just kind of this movement to try to help create interior environments that replicate outdoor habitats. Really interesting. But it's things like plants, and you can see that I've got plants behind me. Fresh air. Fresh air does some really good things. It clears out the CO2, which can actually improve our cognition. There's some really good studies showing that as the air quality of a space gets worse, we don't think as well. And it's just as great getting that breath of fresh air. Living in Grand Rapids, Michigan, I can't always open up my windows in January, but even then might open them up a little bit. And then views. Views are so important so that we can do something other than look at this pane of glass a couple of feet from our face. Sometimes we'll say 2020 rule, meaning every 20 minutes, take 20 seconds to look at something 20ft away or farther just as a way of trying to change your depth perception, get your mind thinking. I actually have put an aquarium in my home office on the other side of the wall. There's some good research indicating that looking at aquariums lower blood pressure. That's why you find them in dentist offices and doctors offices. And so whatever those might be, this combination of views, natural element, lighting. Really you want to be an environment where you feel nurtured and taken care of. So that's surroundings, or at least some of the considerations for surroundings. Now let's talk about the furniture. We need good furniture to be comfortable and productive. 62% of the people that have used our work from home tools said they experienced some discomfort throughout the workday. Top issues, back, shoulders, neck. Those are heavily correlated with our seated posture. Only 24% of people who use the tools said they have ergonomically adjustable work chairs. Interestingly, our research as well as the research, many others, indicate that when you give people the choice of what they can get to improve their home office, they almost always start with good desk chair and for good reason. Let's talk about why. This is a weird thing to say, but your head weighs about what a bowling ball does and it is effectively balanced on top of your spine, which is designed to be in an S shape in order to effectively balance that amount of weight. If your head leans forward too far and that spine can't be in an S, it's almost like putting that bowling ball on the end of a fishing rod and you can imagine the toll that it would take on our neck, shoulders, back. And so we need to try to maintain that S shape in your spine. And as we often say, the eyes will win. Meaning it's usually what we're looking at that draws us into other postures that are sometimes not very helpful. So I'll show you in a minute making sure that, yes, you've got a great chair, but that you think about what you're looking at. And in particular, if you're somebody that uses a really small device, that it's not constantly drawing you forward is really important. In fact, you might even ask yourself right now, what kind of posture are you in? Do you feel like you feel the back of your chair engaged with your back and that you can maintain that S shape? Or are you perched on the front of a chair or a couch leaning in towards something? Ideally, we really don't want that for long durations. The last thing I'll say here about chairs is there's a lot of talk about the importance of lumbar support. It's just kind of gotten into our conventional wisdom that lumbar support is really important. It is important. But you know what else is really important and maybe even more important is sacral support. So our back has different zones. Thoracic higher than Lumbar, than Sacral. That little yellow part of the image is our sacrum. It's right above our tailbone. And as you can see by its shape, it wants to rotate forward like that. And so the picture on the right is one of our chairs, embody. That happens to be the gaming version of it. You can see right at that base to support that sacrum. It rotates the person's hips forward, which does a great job of helping to keep that overall spine in an S shape. So, lumbar support. Yeah, but really pay attention to your sacrum and what your overall back does. When you fully engage with the chair back, I want you to have an image of what really kind of holistically healthy seated posture looks like. So I'm going to violate every principle of PowerPoint and presentation by putting this image, which is kind of an eye chart out there for you. You don't need to read all the details, but I do want you to just soak in on the different facets of this image, starting kind of at the bottom. Her feet are firmly planted on the floor. That's important. Her legs coming out to her knees and down are in that 90 degree shape. And we often see people not doing this. Either they're putting their feet on their chair base or they just can't touch the floor because their chair is adjusted too high, probably because their desk is too high. This kind of acts as an ecosystem. Ideally, we want those feet flat. We want those knees at that 90 degree angle. If they're down too far, we'll get too much pressure on the back of your leg. We don't want that. It can inhibit blood circulation. Likewise, we don't want knees way up above our hips hitting the bottom of the desk, because that's going to be problematic as well. Notice that her back is fully engaged, her arms are to her sides, and in a 90 degree posture excuse me, 90 degree angle with her arms moving forward and her eyes are looking straight ahead. And so we want movement throughout the day. We don't want to sit static like this for long periods of time. But if you want your back to be really effectively supported as well as the rest of your body throughout the workday, keep this image in mind. And if you want to dive deeper into this, by the way, we've got all sorts of videos and other resources on hermiller.com that talks about healthy sitting. Now, let me just talk about a couple of other things, which are our desk surfaces and our storage. 72% of the people that have used our Work from home tools say they do have a dedicated surface, so they're not working from the dining room table, which is great. Only 11% have height adjustable surfaces, which we understand. It's not something that everyone has had a chance to get or can afford. But a couple of considerations. If your desk surface is not height adjustable, either through an electronic mechanism or a manual mechanism, do try to think about getting that desk right when you install it at the best proper height. So high enough so that it's not sitting on those legs, but low enough so that you're not trying to get up to reach it. Many desks do have the ability to be installed at different heights, even if they're not necessarily adjustable after they're installed. So get that right the first time, even if you've got to kind of jerry rig that desk a little bit. But then if you can ideally try to get a height adjustable desk, it has all sorts of benefits. One is what I just said, which is just for normal seated work, it's better because, you know, you can make sure it's at the right height. But then there's also the benefit of getting it up a little bit higher, maybe from when you're on video, so the camera is looking right at you, not up your nose, but also standing. And I do want to say a word or two about sit stand. The goal is not to stand for long periods of time. Standing is actually more harmful over long durations than sitting. And so the ideal is that you're taking breaks throughout the day to adjust that up. Stand for maybe 15 minutes, sit back down. We want movement. Our ergonomists often say your next posture is the best posture and if you don't have that height adjustable surface, you can still get that movement right. Like I said, go to the kitchen and maybe put your laptop there on the counter and work for ten minutes. Come back to your desk. We want that kind of movement. The last thing I'll say here is just like we talked about primary and secondary workspaces surfaces also kind of have like this primary secondary thing. Our desks are our primary surfaces. Ideally, we don't want them cluttered up with tons of stuff that we're not using. So keep that primary surface for the tools and the content and the things that you're primarily working with. Think about having another surface. It could be the top of a storage cabinet where your other anticipated things might be found. Maybe it's where work that you might not reference every day, but you might reference once a week or once a month sits so that we don't find that your primary surface is all cluttered up. Now let's turn our attention to tools and then after that I'll begin to wrap up. There's tons of different tools that we use to do our work, including all of the digital things. But like those surfaces, they also kind of come in primary and secondary forms, meaning your laptop, webcam, mouse, keyboard, maybe microphone, are things you're probably using a lot so they belong on that primary surface. But there's other things. Could be notebooks, could be pens, papers, could be a printer that maybe you want to think about as having in a secondary location once again so that it doesn't clutter up your primary work surface. External monitors or a laptop stand, like what's shown in this image, can be very helpful in terms of maintaining that great posture like we talked about before, because why the eyes always win when we get that surface up, we're less inclined to hunch over looking at a small screen. WiFi extenders and mesh networks also relate a lot to the design of home office space, because sometimes we'll find that there's an area of our home that's a little bit removed from the chaos that we want to use as our primary workspace. But because it is removed, it doesn't get good connectivity. Invest in the tools necessary to get the WiFi to the place that's best. Rather than sacrifice that and find yourself working in the middle of a busy living room. A good WiFi extender or mesh network can do really good things, as can noise canceling headsets. Oh my goodness. They can really deal with some of these spatial things that we can't control. Otherwise, they can help isolate acoustical distractions for you. They can also help reduce the distractions for the person you're interacting with through these microphones that are able to cancel out anything other than voice level frequency. So those are just a handful of the considerations around tools. And then we just need to think about how all of this comes together. I'm going to break another PowerPoint rule by transitioning from these beautiful Herm Miller images to a picture I took an hour ago of my own home workspace. I've worked primarily from home for years. This is what works for me. But you know what? I've done lots of little tweaking and experimentations. I have another bookcase off to the side that you can't see here that holds my printer and some other tools. But I've got a primary work surface that works really well for me. I like to keep it clear. I adjust it a lot. The area behind me, yeah, I can set a few things there, but it's primarily there for plants and other things that make my surroundings into something that I like. And yes, there's a boombox there because I love to crank the tunes when I do email. Loud music and email go really well for me. You also can see I've got an external mic because I do a lot on video. A great ergonomic mouse from Logitech. So think about what's right for you and make it work as a system. And if you still need more information, there's an excellent tool for you, which I've already mentioned many times. Our work from home tool. WFH HermanMiller.com It is not a sales tool. It doesn't recommend any products to you. It is solely there to help make recommendations. It also gives you a score. Don't worry so much about the score. Look at the recommendations and how it's seeking to help you, not only in terms of physical ergonomics, but also some other dimensions that we didn't really unpack yet today, cognitive ergonomics related to how we think and feel, as well as social. We might think of social ergonomics as how the space impacts our relationships. And yes, that's really important in corporate offices where there's lots of people together. It's still really important working from home. You are social people, I'm a social person. We need to think about all facets of our work from home experience. And this tool is designed to help you do that. So I hope that that has given you some new ideas, some new tips. More importantly, a more holistic view of what you can do to take control over the environment around you or to empower your employees to do so to create productive healthier and ultimately just better work from home experiences.

        "transcript_text": "You. Hi, this is Eric Johnson. It's February 18, 2021. And this is the Engineering Key Review at GitLab. So I've got number four in the agenda, which is a proposal to break up this meeting into four department key reviews. So currently, this is engineering, development, quality, security and UX. Infrastructure and Support do their own key reviews already. I have the reasons why increased visibility able to go deeper, increase the objectivity with which my reports can manage their groups, allow me more time to focus on new markets, and allow me to shift into more of a question asker mode than generating content and answering questions in these meetings. But to avoid adding three net new meetings to stakeholders calendars, I propose we do a sort of two month rotation. So Month One development quality go. Month, two security and UX would go how do people feel about that proposal? I think in the group conversations, it's working really well, so I'm supportive. And this is the smallest thing. Maybe we need four meetings a month, like it's the biggest department. It's super essential. But you propose this. I could see either way, so let's stick with the proposal. Cool. We'll try it, and we can be flexible. I mean, development is larger. Maybe they go more frequently or something like that, but we'll see how it goes. All right. And then I've got number five, which is we've got R and D overall Mr rate, and we also have R and D wider Mr rate, both as top level KPIs for engineering. So the difference between them in the simplest sense is that R D wider Mr rate includes both community contributions and community Mrs. The problems I see with this are that one, the wider Mr rate, the one that includes internal and external Mrs, it duplicates the overall Mr rate, which is. The wider Mr rate should just be external. Right. And then overall should be narrow plus wider, like we say, the wider community. Right. Okay. I'll have to check the taxonomy. Lily, can you confirm Sid's reasoning is my understanding as well? Yeah, I believe Water Mr rate just captures community contributions only and no internal. Yeah. And the reason we measure that is that one of the most likely failure modes is that we lose the. Gets. Eric, where it gets goofy is that when you look at a specific team within the company, there could be contributions outside of that that aren't community contributions. They would be viewed community contributions by that group, but effectively, they're not from outside the company. So that's why we use wider to kind of reflect that. And narrow is very specific to the team. Are you saying that if someone in plan contributes to verify, it's viewed as wider? Not quite. That plan and verify are just fine. It's when you look at the development versus infrastructure, infrastructure will oftentimes contribute to developments work, but it won't be counted as Mrs. Okay, that's a potential bit of funkiness that we should talk about separately. I didn't have that in my sort of critique of this, but that doesn't necessarily make intuitive sense to me. So then I think part of my critique of this can be thrown out because it's not as duplicative as I thought. But I still think there's a problem with R and D wider Mr rate, which is this thing doesn't really move in part because it's a rate. So it feels like the way to drive this up is to specifically drive community authors to contribute more than one Mr per month. That's how this moves up because it's a productivity rate like we use internally. And that doesn't necessarily feel like the right thing because there are scenarios in which this goes up. We've actually got less contributions overall and less contributors overall. Wait a second. So you're saying that R and D wider Mr rate is number Mrs per external contributor. Oh my goodness. That should not be the thing. It should be contributions per GitLab team member. So the thing above the division is the external ones. The thing below is the number of team members at GitLab. Is that the case, Lily? I'm checking right now. I think so in our new merge per team member. So unless we start calling people outside the company team member, then it shouldn't be that. Yeah, just clarifying here. So our numerator is community contributions and then our denominator is GitLab team members. So it's not per external member. What we're doing there, Eric, is we're not trying to say how many Mrs does someone send? If they send something, we're saying how many Mrs from external do we get for the size of our organization? It, sorry, I have a childhood emergency outside the door. Maybe explain the context behind this. The context is as we grow as a company, we should make sure we keep the community up. Like the logical thing is for the community to flatline and the size of the ORC to grow, and before you know it, you've kind of outgrown the wider community. Yeah. What I'm seeing is we created this pretty sophisticated taxonomy with prefixes and post fixes to talk about these things, but in reality we've only got two of them and we keep forgetting and we have a hard time discussing this thing. So I'd rather just name them simply two names for what they are rather than using the taxonomy. But also in F, I have this proposal of like, what if we just tracked as a KPI the percentage of total Mrs that come from the community over time and we would see that drop. I love that. Let's do that instead. Okay, but the thing why we have this complex thing is because you can game that you want to game that. You just produce fewer Mrs with the engineers at GitLab. So if you drive that really hard and say, this is your number one goal. It's very easy to achieve it's. Just tell all your engineers to produce half. Yeah. So we have different metrics to prevent that from happening. The same way that support SLAs and SSAC kind of buttress one another. I think we're robust to that. But simplifying this would make these conversations. Go much if you, as our CTO, don't even understand them. We went overboard. So I'm supportive did understand them. And I forgot and when I was reviewing the stuff this morning, I'm like, there's a problem with this. And then you just remind me of the context. So, yeah, if I can't hold it. In my head, percentage that come from the community, I love that. It's what all our investors ask about. Let's do that. Okay, cool. So, Lily, if you can work with Mac to make that transition, that would be great. And I'll bold the one that we're talking about. That's Roman RAML three. Thanks. I'm on the call. Sorry it was a bit late. Timeline. We do have PiS on the raw number of community Mrs, and we can make the shift and wider confirming from the definition. I think wider only counts for community, and that's what the definition is. Cool. All right, so number six then. Christopher? Sorry, I was looking up to see if I had the percentage graph because I think we played around with this at one point and had a draft of that probably about five months back, if I can remember. Lily, just an FYI, the month of February. If you were looking at any particular metrics, particularly in development at an Mr eight, we haven't had updates in four days. There's apparently a lag issue that's been problematic for the data team to basically get updated metrics, and they're working on that. I'm sorry, Mech, you got the next one. So, yeah, there's some color there on mitigation the lag later on to seven. I said FYI in addition to the KDPI status. I'm sorry, Mac. I wanted to just touch on the postgres replication issue there real quick. I've been trying to get my arms wrapped around it. Do we have the right attention to this? This is kind of eric, I don't know if you were commenting on hinting towards this in the last meeting around some of the infrastructure improvements on the product side. I'm just not quite sure whose responsibility it is to focus on getting a handle on some of the constraints we have on replication. Yeah, what I was mentioning in the product you review about an hour ago, I think is sort of like unrelated. And so I think the DRI needs to be your kind of data engineering team. But of course, there's a dependency on infrastructure because that's where the data is being piped from. They do own that data source. Yeah. I'll say for the replication lag on that slave host where I'm sorry, not on the secondary host where the data is being pulled from the infrastructure would be the DRA for that. And so any escalations, but I'll own those and I know we have an action plan for that as far as creating another dedicated host just for the data team to pull. Did ask I saw that issue and I did talk to Craig Gomes a little bit as well on the database side just to see if there's some database improvements. And I'm still trying to figure out if it's truly just dedicated computational sort of resource, a server or if there's actually some database tuning that needs to occur. Do you have a sense of that? I'd say it's three different things. It's having a dedicated host that doesn't have conflicting query traffic coming from other workloads. There are some tuning performance or tuning improvements to be made and then there's also improvements in and this is where it does maybe relate a little bit to what the topic was in the last review. Basically the overall demand on the database layer from.com activities and improving those. So it's definitely not just one of those things. But one of the most specific actions we're going to take though is separating out and having a dedicated host so that we're just dealing with the profile of the data engineering traffic on there and not having conflicting queries affect the ability to update the replication. Steve, I definitely want to partner with you on this one because I think the demand on those databases is only going to increase, it's not going down. And I think we need to get I'm still unclear on where to focus in to get the biggest bang for the buck. I think if the computational resource dedication, that's going to be a good thing, but probably going to squeeze the balloon and then the next area will unearth itself. Okay, and I'll tell you what, I'll put into the infra key review for next week, an update on this issue. Thank you, Steve. So then back to mechan seven or yes. Thank you. And Rob was in the assassin this morning as well. Brian, just we have the attention there. Number seven, just provide an update on previous conversations. We're continuing to improve defect tracking and against SLOs. There is a first iteration Pi that we are experimenting to show percentage of defects meeting the SLOs key findings. S ones are hovering at 80%, s two at 60. We've been focused mostly on S one, s two S at this point, hence why s three and s four S are lower and this will likely be the case. We are also in point B are working on the measurement for average open bugs age. This will give us a whole picture of what's left if the age goes up or down. If we are cleaning the backlog, the average age should go down as well. There's no pi yet, but I just want to update and ensure that we are on this. It's not off track. Number C. Craig on s two. Yeah, just I was looking through the charts and I noted that there was a spike in meantime to close and just wanted to see if you had any insight into that for us. This is the S two s. The S one looked fine. Yeah, this is where the point be on age. Supplemental charts in the back end helps. So I haven't seen a dip in age nor the count overall. I think it's the latter. We need to dig in a bit deeper in that and also the data lag. I would like to reevaluate when we have the whole picture, when everything is synced in as well. Christy, you have some insights? Yeah, I'm just wondering if part of this could be the fact that we changed the severity across the board for Mrs to S two and so we may have some older bugs in there that hadn't been addressed because they were at a lower severity. Now we've moved them to S two and maybe that caused a little spike. That could be the case. If we did it in a limited fashion, it won't be a huge volume. We also iterated after that to pin on priority since product owns prioritization. So I wouldn't account it entirely to that. This isn't the infra key review, but I know that they've gotten backed up on those issues. So if some good portion of those are infra created or related, then that might be lifting it as well. I can take the deeper dig in and then provide an update next time. I think we need extra debug slicing of the data here. Did you like to go to zero eight? Yeah. We are now measuring S one, S Two slo achievement with closed bugs. But if you then look at the number of bugs, it's exponential growth and then it will be trivial to achieve 100% slo achievement. If you just look at closed bugs, even though there would be a major problem in the company, 99% of all bugs are overdue. As long as I only close ones that are still within the slo, I'll have great achievement. So I think we shouldn't be looking at the closed bugs. I think we should be looking at open bugs, the entire population. What percentage of those is within the slo time? I think we're doing it the wrong way. Thanks for the feedback, Sid. Hence why we wanted to have the average age to measure what's outside in the open. We can make this iteration to also measure focus on the age of all opened, including open bugs. This is all something I have discussed with Christopher in the next iteration as well. And we're more than happy to yeah, go ahead. So average age would get closer to it. It's not what I'm proposing. What I'm proposing is of the open bugs, what percentages outside of slo. So display it as a percentage. You do now. Just do it about the open bugs, not the closed one. Got it. Okay. The exceeding Slo for open bugs. Yeah. Or open bugs that are within Slo. So you have a chart that should go up and to the right like everything else. Sounds great. We can take it to the next data metrics work stream to deliver. A little tricky Mac. You'll have to figure out how to because we like to be able to have charts that we can historically reconstruct if we need to. So when tickets close out, you need to go through the history to figure out at this time when it was open, did it breach the Slo or not? That's a good point. This might be much harder computationally, so I totally respect if we can do it for that reason. Cool. Nine craig? Yeah, I just wanted to ask the team. I went through all the key meeting metrics. Everything looked in line with prior periods and looked good. Is there anything the team wants to call out, supposedly, that we should be watching? Yeah, I'll call out Sus. So the good news is, in Q Four, we had our smallest decline over several quarters, so we only went down by a 10th of a point. The quarter previous was 0.6 or six tenths of a point, and the quarter before that was a full point. So we see this as an improvement, even though it was still a decline, but it's still a decline. Obviously, we want this actually tracking in an upward direction. We also don't have enough data to know whether or not this is an actual real trend up, so I'm optimistic. I think this is a good thing. We have had a much keener focus on Sus over the past several quarters. So that's why I think okay. The work that we've done, I think, actually is catching up and getting noticed in Sus. But we got to keep an eye on it. We cannot assume that that's the case. Yeah. And the bug discussion above just kind of points out that we have an underlying problem right now in our metrics measurement. So if we change the measurements to reflect that, then hopefully we're in good shape. If we don't and we flatline and address it so that we flatline open S Ones and S two S, you will see a temporary jump above SLOs as we clear out that backlog over that period of time. And I have point C, which is similar to infrastructure. We need to get more security work prioritized or hearing that from the team. But neither that problem nor that activity is sort of currently reflected in our security metrics. So we have some work to do long term to make sure that we see things like that in the metrics and the measurements that we're making. So back to you, Sid Ten. Yeah. The narrow Mr rate seems significantly below target, and maybe I hope that it would bounce back from December. I think it bounced back, but not back on target. Any context there? What's going on? Yeah. So with family and friends days, we actually had some heavier vacation days in January than we historically have. One thing to note is that we are actually at a higher Mr rate. If you go back the last 18 months, we're actually at a higher narrow Mr rate than we were back in each month this year. So if you compare October to October, November to November, november, December and January comparatively to last year, what you'll find is we're between a half point and a 1.5 Mr rate above where we were in the month of previous year. That's great context. Thank you, Christopher. Good work. Yeah. So the expectation is that February is a short month. We are at, I think, 16 work days with friends and family day and other things. Obviously, us having car outages in Texas doesn't help things either for the folks who are working in Texas, but hopefully the rest of the team is being effective. I was hoping to see a better result right now, but with four or five days, particularly around release week, that's usually when we do see a little bit higher activity. So that's not accounted for yet. But March is when I'm expecting to kind of see a real rebound, much like we did last year. Awesome. Thanks. The other context I'll give is we now do time series targets, so when we change the target, you'll see that reflected in the line. So if we were to look back historically here, the goal here was actually lower, and Christopher was ambitious and we kept raising it and we kept meeting that. So it should stairstep here and we could go back and reconstruct that if we really wanted to. And then ignoring the sort of the seasonal dip here, we raised it to, I think, eleven. And then we realized we're kind of hitting that point of diminishing returns and the right thing to do business wise, and this is in our FY 22 direction, is hold the line at productivity, but start to raise other things related to quality, security, availability and whatnot. So that's kind of why you're seeing this bump, is we raised it and we realized, okay, we shouldn't raise it anymore, and we brought it back down to ten. So ten will be the target going forward. I'm going to try to get better at a lot of other things while preventing this from dipping. Cool. And I just want to call out that it's not necessarily higher. Mr rates should also help to address security and quality and other things because you're more productive, so you can fix more things. So it's not necessarily opposite. But I agree with let's hold the line ten is a great number and focus on other indicators to improve. That makes a ton of sense. All cool. Well said. All right, that's it for the agenda. Anyone want to vocalize anything else? Great. Well, thanks, everybody. And I'm going to go check on my four year old and see if she got whatever she needed. So cheers and talk soon. Thanks, Eric.",

        "transcript_text": "I'm thrilled to welcome to the stage joeb Vandervort and Marcelo Lebri, the co founders of Remote. We know there are many advantages of embracing remote work, but to get there, we have to get the basics right first. Job and Marcelo have extensive experience in remote work, leadership and practice. And their company's really been a pioneer in remote collaboration and communication. They now have employees in dozens of countries across six continents, so they know how to tackle the complexities that can arise with a global workforce. If your team is wondering how to best hire in other countries, how to design processes that will work across time zones, and even how to gauge performance, you're going to get your questions answered during this session. Let's listen in. All right, we're live. Well, this is interesting, Marcelo. We talk every single day, but now the rest of the world gets to see us talk to each other. We have to censor ourselves a little bit. Maybe to start off, let's start with the introduction. So I'm yop. I'm the CEO and co founder of Remote. Marcelo, I'm CTO and co founder at Remote. And maybe to start, what we can do is I can tell a little bit about why and we started Remote and how that came to be. And then you can correct all my mistakes and exaggeration. Before Remote, we were different companies. And actually, I was at GitLab. So I joined GitLab approximately when it was founded. And of course, as everybody that is listening to this knows, GitLab has a fully distributed team. And one of the things we struggled with at GitLab was exactly that we would hire someone in a country you never hired someone before. And we then had to figure out, well, how do we pay that person? How do we stay compliant? How do we provide benefits? And what I saw was that doing that one was a huge pain for everybody involved. And the experience was never really, really good. And any vendors that helped out with that were generally quite poor. So after five years at GitLab, which I thought was sufficient amount of time, even though it was an amazing company, this is me sucking up to the organizers of the event. We decided to start a company together specifically to solve that problem. And so Remote today exists for that purpose. We make it possible for you as an employer or as an employee, to hire anybody anywhere in the world. And it means that we, as Remote, we have local entities all throughout the world. There, we act as an employer of record. So that, let's say you want to hire Jane in Portugal. Remote, Portugal hires Jane. We provide payroll and benefits and everything else that comes with that, and then we invoice the actual employer. So, for example, GitLab. And that way for GitLab, the problems are solved in terms of how do we stay compliant, how do we provide benefits, and for Jane, it's a nice situation as well, because we're an experienced employer, so we just take care of everything and it's generally a good experience. And so that's what Remote does in quite a few countries now, since about two and a half years ago. What did I miss? Marcel anything. They also look good. It's a good thing about the team. And it's been quite incredible because we started all this before this crazy time, all this that we hear and feel about Pandemic. And it was already very much for a lot of companies and people, the reality and the need was more than there. We've seen it become a trend way before we started Remote. But the current situation of the world was a catalyst for all this. And I feel that all this, all the remote work, remote company is very much bringing the future of work to today, actually our present. And it feels quite good to be part of all this. Yeah, I think the nice thing is what we saw at GitLab already was that the benefits of remote work are and being a distributed company are so incredibly large. Right. And then over the past year and a few months, I think most of the world had started to work from home, forced to work from home. And now slowly, people are finally able to experience remote work without feeling you have to be locked at home. I think it's still a long way to go. But remote work during a Pandemic is not the kind of remote work that I was lucky to experience. And the reason why we started the company, because there's so many benefits to it. It's really incredible. Marcel so that's why we started Remote. Do you want to tell a little bit about our company? Like the kind of company we have in terms of culture? Yeah, there are a few things that were paramount when we started this. Right. We wanted to build something that truly mattered, that allowed companies to have a full world of possibilities, to hire people for rather than just locality and people that are around on the same country or similar geographies. And also for people to empower people, whatever they are in the world, independently of how the country is doing, and to get a good, great job as if they were in places like, I don't know, New York, London, San Francisco, you name it. And you can only do this if you realize the difference that exists in the world, the diversity and the needs for inclusivity in all similar topics. So if you're building this for people, if you're building this so that people can have the future of work becomes something where people actually enjoy life rather than live to work. It has to fundamental embody that right. So we set up five very fundamental values at the beginning of our journey. Kindness, ownership, ambition, transparency and excellence. Now, these may sound like buzwords. But the truth to the matter is that these are not company values. These are people values. We chose those because they represent what we feel that the future of work should be and how the future workplaces should behave in a way and enable people and promote people to live better lives. And that was the core, I believe, of what we set out to do. I think when we were two it was quite easy. Now at 250, I can say that it's a lot harder. It's not I think that it resonates a lot with people, even people that were in companies that were not very transparent or kind. But these are again, human values and so it's very easy for people to relate to and to also want to keep them because we all know what it feels like to work in places without those values. And if the future of work is whatever we want it to be then surely it can summarize what we feel like. And those values are that in a. Way, I think the interesting thing is that when you tell people, well, one of our values is kindness, everybody responds with wow, that's so great. And then I join and they say it really is true and it's just a little bit sad that that is what people are surprised by because it's such an incredibly low threshold to get to that point, right? Your job is in the end just a job and so let's make it nice. You spend a lot of hours, maybe 8 hours, five days a week. That's a lot of time. You really want to make sure that that time at least you spend feeling challenged in the right ways and other than that, having a comfortable relationship with your colleagues. I think that's, at least for me, kindness is one of the values that there's no compromises made to that ever. You can always be kind to people, especially all we're talking about is business and technology. There's no reason ever to not be kind to your colleagues. But yeah, I think it really helped for us to build the business stooled on those things. First one, those really strong values, the fact that we are distributed and wherever we can hire, we will hire. We make a point out of hiring there. We don't specifically look for people in a particular region or decide we're going to expand to a particular territory. And the nice thing, of course, for us is that we're able to build and use our own product in doing so. So we have hundreds, if not thousands of customers by now that do exactly the same thing. And I think that's very exciting because what we see is that people start to and companies start to hire from anywhere. They say well, we can hire you wherever remote can help us. And in doing so they build really nice organizations, very diverse organizations in almost every sense of the word. And I think you see that at the remote as well, where we have quite a diverse organization, and that's not because we put particular emphasis on it in terms of in almost any way. I think the only thing we do is we just look for great people wherever they are, and if you hire those people, you're going to end up with a really diverse organization, which is really nice, and it helps a lot with all the other parts as well with all the other values. I fully agree. I think in the old excuse of, I mean, the team all looks the same because we just hired locally. It's no longer the case. You have a full world of possibilities of people you can hire and you can meet, and that will increase the productivity and the different values within the company and bring so much richness to the culture into discussions that it's immeasurable, it's insane. It's a totally different world, I'd say. So for remote work, I think fundamental is working asynchronously right? Why is it absolutely necessary? Because people live in different time zones. There's no magical cure to time zones. We can't all work the same nine to five. That's going to horribly break. And besides that, I don't like to work nine to five. I like to work whenever I feel like working and not at the moments where I don't. So asynchronous work. Marcella, what is it? Why is it how do you do it? It's it seems like a very big, ugly word, and also we've seen lately being around, being thrown around for a lot of different reasons. But essentially it is to understand that you can't depend on people always to be online working with you at the same time, and that it's the opposite of you working. Someone coming by and saying, hey, do you want to chat about this? And patting on the back, and then you have to take your headset, look very upset and smell other people as well. The Async work allows you to plan the work according to your availability, making sure that some things you do on your own, because it's just the nature of most jobs, and the other things that you need to collaborate on, you can plan ahead when you're going to collaborate on. So you will not assume if people are online or not. I mean, we could be in the same time zone, but we have kids, so we know how much that changes your time zone and availability. The async way of working allows you to exactly space out in time your slots, where you can be highly productive when you're going to work alone, when you're going to need others and also make sure that everyone is always sort of in the flow, in sense that if you want to block a point of time to just work on something, you can do so. And if the other person you depend on to do some tasks also needs something done. You can both do that and then eventually come together to build something. So the asynchronous way of working is not just a way to increase productivity because it respects people's needs and time, but it's more inclusive. You don't make assumptions. If someone is working, as you said, nine to five, I don't know, it depends on the country, the culture. Some people love to work like straight on and it's fine. Other people do prefer to take breaks and do life and that's perfect as well. We just do different things and we are fundamentally different people. And for that reason, Async work is one of the core tenets of remote work. We have people distributed all over the world. On top of that, most of these people work from home. And we know there's a lot of distractions, there's animals and pets and things happening and the mail person coming in, cleaning person barging in and things like that. We know that you can't always be on at your peak productivity. And so what is the point, for instance, what's the point of you being at work when you don't feel like when you don't feel productive, where you're wasting three times 3 hours to do something? You usually take 10 minutes, right? Just take a break, go do you? And then you come back later and you're super productive in those 5 minutes, five to 10 minutes. And that's the basics of async work. It's not magical, it's just respectful. I think the nice thing is that if you work asynchronous well, or to be able to work asynchronously well, you have to trust people. You have to give them ownership and you have to give them independence because you have a task. And if you get stuck on that task, you have to be able to or you get stuck at a moment of decision, a fork in the road, for example. You have to be able to give people the trust and the ownership that they actually take that decision themselves and not wait on other people. Otherwise it's impossible to work asynchronously, right? And this is what you see in offices where I come into a fork in the road in my work. And this is what would happen, of course I would walk over to someone, to my boss or my manager, I would wave them over and say what do I do? Go left or right? And then if you work asynchronously that person, one, you don't really want to ask them, but even if you wanted to, they might be asleep or they might be at the gym or whatever else. And so if you give people trust and ownership, then they will have to make and they will make the decision themselves. And I think the interesting thing here is that if you think about this a lot, that the overhead of waiting for consensus or even just waiting for approval of a peer might be and it probably is significantly more expensive than the cost of reverting a decision that they made wrongly. Because usually people don't make the wrong decision, right? Usually they have a good idea about the direction. There's very little situation which is actually like the toss of the die where depending on the outcome it might be one or the other. Usually there's something weighted and then a person can just make a decision comfortably or sometimes just based on taste, for example can be million different things. I think that makes remote work and I always say this remote work is such a great forcing function for good habits because you are forced to give people trust, you're forced to give people independence and that just benefits everybody. No one likes to have someone looking over their shoulder and then helping them make or like pointing out to on their screen what to do and what decisions to be made. Everybody likes to just get work done, right? Get shit done. It's nice. You sit down, you make decisions, you go from beginning to end. And that doesn't mean that you can't work together with colleagues. That's a very different thing in of itself. You can do that. And there's no reason you can't do that remotely. But when you just want to get stuff done, it feels much nicer if you don't feel the need to constantly get approval or get sign offs. And then when there's moments where you do have that, then you have to organize your work in a way that if you actually get locked or you're actually running up to a review mode right in code if you want to merge something. You are going to assign it to someone so that they can review your merge request. That's a very natural point to get there. And then the person has to have enough ownership to say, oh, I'm going to pick. Up this other task or I'm going to start working on something else while I wait for my colleagues to wake up, get back from the supermarket and review my merge request. And so you have this really strong forcing. Function towards trust, towards ownership that ultimately benefits everybody in almost any situation. It has very little downsides because if you do want to work together if you do want to even sitting together or directly collaborating or just casually to do. We're all working, but we are talking with each other. You can do all of those things online as well. So she gets so much more for free. So I think that is one of my favorite things. About remote work is that you can have it all. One of the things that people ask very often, people, especially people that never actually work at Singh, is like, what does that do to the culture of the company, the team? And it's quite interesting to see that the assumption is well it's just people working on different things, the culture will be quite damaged and it's quite the opposite. Because when people decide to share time and a call or a hangout session, it is deliberate. It's not like, well, I have to go, I was having a coffee and someone came in and I'm going to have to chitchat because I'm having my coffee. No, it's fundamentally deliberate. There's also something that it is impactful the fact that what you see here, this is my life, I'm in my house. The things that go by that there's a kid running around or my dog making noises, there's always my life story behind it. And so what is shared, it is more powerful, it is more deliberate. And the impact on the company is that you actually build more sincere environments and serve, no bullshit. Because if you don't want to hang out with someone, you just don't open the zoom call or don't join a session because you're doing what you want to be doing at that time. And that empowers everyone, yourself, as an individual, the team and ultimately the company. Because what you want is to create an environment where everyone is welcome to either just focus on work, share if they feel like sharing, or not sharing, because we all have our days and sometimes we don't really feel like sharing. And I think it is different. It's not better or worse than working in an office. It's just fundamentally different. I think the biggest key to bringing Remote work into the future of work is accepting that is just fundamentally different. It's a different reality. The relationship with work sort of changes in a sense that if you don't want it to be the epicenter of your social life, it doesn't have to be so. And you're not forced in a situation where it is. So if you do want to socialize a lot with your colleagues and I think we see this at Remote, where we have many colleagues that do get together very regularly, also in person, but also, like, online, and they hang out and they work together. But then we have many other colleagues that don't do that and that prefer to just do work and then live the rest of their life, which is I don't know how it sounds, but I like the idea that the relationship with work doesn't have to be like as you said in the beginning, life shouldn't revolve around work. Right? Like, work should be a facet of your life and maybe an important facet of your life that is up to you, but nonetheless should be facet of your life and not dictate where you live, when you live, where you live. I think that's such an antiquated idea, even though that's basically been the status quo for the past hundreds of years. The fact that you can switch houses, countries, even without having to worry about your income, your family or your safety. I think it's sometimes priceless, in some cases priceless. Yeah. I moved between countries when I was working at GitLab, and then just a few weeks ago, I moved again between countries. And in of itself, it's a pain. It's really nice that nothing about your work situation changes. It just stays completely the same. And then the last little bit about bureaucracy and legal, that is what our company solves. That's the last little thing, I think maybe interesting to get into it as like a last subject here, I hear very often. Okay, but you do everything remotely. Sure. But how do you make sure people do their work well? How do you train people? How do you manage performance? And I think notoriously there are several organizations that have to start to really track their employees. And I know if you're on TikTok, you might have seen videos of people attaching like, a mouse to a fan so that a mouse is always moving so it looks like someone is online and having activity. I think we don't have to tell anybody. That's not the way to deal with performance. But you Marcel, as a leader of many engineers and other people, how do you manage performance in a remote team? Yeah, I think there's some misunderstanding about what performance is within the context of work. A lot of the use case is mostly binary. You're either achieving what you're supposed to or not. Now, you only should get into measuring things when something is off, like your customers aren't happy, you're not delivering what you thought you should be delivering, or something is happening that is not supposed to be. And in that case, it's worth looking into. Other than that, it's just not. Now, often the case for not having the expected performance is not on the employee. I'd say 99% is not on the employee. It is about the expectations that were set. The employer did hire that person. They are supposed to know they've done their due diligence, understanding if there was a good match between the job and the person and setting the person up for success is key to that relationship. Now, we do know that sometimes things fail and some mismatches happen well, such as life. And then you employ whatever you need to employ. Performance Improvement Plan you work with the person to get two specs, or you understand that the work that you're expecting is completely off, and you have to adjust that to the team that you have and the people and to your business as well. Now, having been a manager and this is my probably 7th team, I believe there's no difference. There's absolutely no difference. What I've seen in the past is that offices can detract way more than working in sync for the single fact that when someone is in the flow, like focused on working on something, there's always something happening. Someone getting up, getting a coffee, asking if you want to also get a coffee or someone wanting to show you cat pictures and all that is way more distracting. The commute and all that retracts a lot of energy. And then it is way trickier to understand if the problem behind performance comes from the relationship between the job, the expectation and the person, or from anything else, like the environment, whatever. And I think that with remote work, you can remove away all those variables that happen around it and focus on the problem if you have it, or on the great results if you have them as well. I think one of the interesting things here is that when employers say, how do I know people are actually doing the work? I always question like, what is the work that you're doing that you don't know that your employees are actually performing any work? It should be really obvious whether they are creating value or not, right? Like things should break or things should not happen if they are not working, rather than you tracking whether they're moving their mouse, it should be actually having value. If you have a manager with, let's say, up to ten reports or so, that manager should be able to at least have an idea of what is happening with each one of these people and whether they have been absent completely or not. It really baffles me to see this in almost any situation. Even in a situation where you have one manager with many, many reports, like in a call center, for example, right, it's very obvious that there's going to be a change in capacity in a team if someone is completely not doing their work. So it really baffles me that employers find the need to track people when you can just literally look at their work. The basic minimum thing as a manager, which is very similar, I think what you were referencing, which is people that consider themselves great managers in offices many times are not great managers in offices. They are just people that like to look over the shoulder and observe the physical behavior of people in the office. And that's a very different thing. I don't think that's managing I don't think that is like enabling your team. I think that's just being a bit of an ass. And again, remote work is such a good forcing function for this, right? Because it becomes super obvious what is a good manager? Who is a good manager and really who isn't great? Anything else to share, marcel I think we're at time. I think we're on time. Yeah. Very nice. Thanks everybody. If you want to know more about remote remote, it's very easy. And then if you Google our names, you'll find us on Twitter and you can ask us anything there.

        "transcript_text": "You. Now let's hear from one of the world's leading experts in remote work, professor Raj Chaudhry from Harvard Business School. Raj was studying remote work practices before the worldwide shift to remote in 2020. His research has formed the basis for many policies and practices since. And now he turns his attention to an area that we all need to understand better internal networks in the distributed space. How can we help new team members make connections and advance in their careers? Raj is going to share with us the results of a study on virtual water cooler chats and how they affect individual performance outcomes. Can an informal conversation with a senior manager make a measurable difference in a newcomer's career? Let's find out. Hello. My name is Raj Chaudhary, and I'm an associate professor at the Harvard Business School. I study the future of work, and most importantly, for many years now before the Pandemic even, I've been studying what I call work from anywhere, which is a form of remote work that allows employees, individuals, to live where they want to live and not be where the company has an office. And so I've been studying all remote companies, such as GitLab, but others, too, such as Zapier and Doist and Seek for several years as well. And today, I'll be sharing some of my research on one of the problems that comes up all the time when I discuss with CEOs and CHROs about remote work. So let me share my slides, and then I'll go through my material. But feel free to please ask your questions on chat at any point during this talk. Thank you. So what I'm going to talk about today is what I call virtual water coolers. And you might have heard this term before, even if you have not that's okay. I'll tell you what these are, and then I'll discuss the results from an experiment that me and my colleagues were able to run last summer. So now you know what I did last summer. So first, I would like to spend a little bit of time talking about work from anywhere. Work from anywhere is a form of remote work, but it's not the same as just working from home. So when you think about working from home, that is something probably a majority of knowledge workers have now experienced. So I shared this picture from the study done by a team from Stanford, which shows this employee working from home. And the general format for working from home is you work from home three or four days a week. Then you go to the office. So you essentially are stuck to the location where the company has an office in work from anywhere. You can now relocate to a location of your choice. So this is a map showing where the US. Patent Office allowed its employees to spread out in 2015. That's correct. They sort of started this work from anywhere program in 2012, and so by 2015, folks had spread out to Florida, to California, to every part of the country. So each dot is a US patent exemplary. And so I call this live and work anywhere. And what this form of remote work does is it allows employees to enjoy what I call geographic flexibility. So you can choose where to live. So if cost of living is a big concern, you can go to a cheaper town. If you want to be closer to your family, so be it. And this really shifts the ballgame in terms of where talent lives. So just to summarize what I found in my research related to work from anywhere, the benefits to individuals is pretty obvious. But I have made the business case to many, many companies through my research that this is also a win win for companies. And so there are four main things that I found in my research for why work from anywhere is a great policy for companies. So the first and foremost reason is work from anywhere allows companies to hire from anywhere. So you're not stuck to just hiring from the labor market where you have an office. You can now hire from anywhere in the world. So if the talent lives in Kenya, in Ireland, in Bangladesh, you don't even need to give them a visa to immigrate to the US. So that's the biggest reason you become a talent magnet. The company becomes a talent magnet when it embraces work from anywhere. And I have plenty of research that documents that. The second thing that I found in my research is work from anywhere leads to productivity gains, at least in some settings that I've carefully looked at. I'm not claiming this is going to be always true, but it's definitely true under some conditions. And I'll show you one graphic in a minute. The third reason is when you embrace work from anywhere as a company, you create a more inclusive workforce. And let me just explain that with one example. So if you think about gender and workplace, for many years, women have borne the brunt of dual career families. So even if the woman had a great promotion opportunity or a job opportunity, that might mean that she had to relocate from Kansas to New York, from New York to Silicon Valley. And often the spouse couldn't move or wouldn't want to move, and the woman had to let go of the opportunity. But if the company embraces work from anywhere, the employee can get promoted or can get additional responsibility without relocating. So you solve the problem of dual careers. And so this, in my opinion, creates a more inclusive workforce. And finally, last but not the least, when you embrace work from anywhere, as the example of GitLab and several other all remote companies have shown, you don't need real estate, or at least don't need as much real estate. And that can be a significant source of savings, especially for startups. I can speak all day on why work from Anywhere is great for companies. But let me focus on and this is just the graphic showing how the productivity of patent examiners went up and stayed up when the Patent office embraced work from anywhere in 2012. If you're interested in this research, the paper is available on my Web page. You're free to take a look. So today, for the rest of my talk, I'm going to focus on this question that comes up again and again. So I've heard CEOs in CHRO say, Raj, we get it all the benefits you described seem meaningful, but how do we facilitate informal interactions in a remote workplace? And this is especially salient for organizational newcomers, interns, new employees who do not know anyone in the company. How do we make sure these folks have informal interactions in a remote workplace? And relatedly, what I've heard many CEOs say is, don't we miss those serendipitous water cooler conversations that we used to have in the physical office? And isn't that something that we should preserve? And shouldn't that be a reason we should all go back to the office? So I've thought about that question for a long time very deeply, and let me share some insights. First, relate to what I think about interactions in the office. It is true that we have these cafeteria conversations, hallway conversations, and water cooler conversations in the office. But if you think deeply about with who do you have these interactions? It's typically people who are physically sitting close to us in adjacent cubicles, maybe the same floor of the office. So the top graphic on the left actually shows research by Tom Allen, which was done in the 1970s, where he showed that these in office communication patterns decayed exponentially after 25 meters. And if there was a wall between the two employees, the conversation happened much more rarely. And if there was a ceiling between the two employees, if the employees were sitting on different floors, you almost never had a water cooler conversation. And think about the implication of that. So what's going to happen? And what used to happen is folks had water cooler conversations with people just like them. So interns spoke to interns, new employees spoke to new employees, sales spoke to Sales, r and D spoke to R and D. And that's a big source of why we get these organizational silos. So the thinking that I've put forward is that we can break these silos, these hierarchical silos, these organizational silos, these functional silos by organizing virtual water coolers. So what is a virtual water cooler? A virtual water cooler is not, first of all, a zoom happy hour, because in a zoom happy hour, only the same set of people tend to show up again and again, and they tend to be all extroverts and friends of each other. So a virtual water cooler is a session, a zoom session. Microsoft team session or a Google hangout session, which is organized by someone in the company, maybe HR, maybe the head of remote. Someone in the company curates this randomly constructed group every week. And folks come together for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, to talk about work, to talk about what's happening in the company, to talk about what's happening in their personal lives. But the main design principle is it's a randomly constructed group. So someone in the company sits down with the list of employees and then mixes them up. So you get the CEO speaking to interns, you get R D speaking to sales, you get Houston talking to Jakarta, and you never know who you're going to meet this week. So if you do this over time, what happens is for every employee, you are broadening the organizational network that you know inside the company. Now, this was the idea that I had early last year. And then the question was, what does these virtual water coolers do for productivity? We didn't know the answer. So we teamed up with a large global organization which was conducting a summer internship remotely. And so what we did is we took the group of couple of thousand interns and ran an experiment. So in this experiment, there were two treatment conditions and three control conditions, which the graphic on the left shows. So the two treatment conditions were where the interns randomly met some really, really senior managers at this company. That was the first treatment condition. The second treatment condition was when these interns met other interns, but randomly again. And then we had three control conditions, one related to informal asynchronous text based communication. Then we had a team project where you met the same interns but every week and worked on a formal project. And then finally, the passive control group received none of these. So they just had free time. And then we ran this week on week. So every week there would be a random lottery assigning people to one of these conditions. So you got assigned to one of these five conditions, and then every week there was a second lottery which said, do you get your condition this week or not? So that's what we call a dose effect. So you could meet a senior manager two times, three times, four times, one time, or none at all. So this is the focus of the experiment, thinking about how do these randomly constructed interactions with senior managers affect your productivity outcomes. And what we find in a nutshell, and once again, the paper is on my web page, we find that these randomly constructed water coolers with the senior managers affected performance in a positive way week on week. And the two bars that I'm showing you here, the green bar is where the senior manager did not share the same demographic characteristics as the intern. And the yellow bar is showing the effect if the intern and the senior manager shared demographic similarity. So what we find here is that the senior manager water cooler has an effect on average, and the effect is really, really strong if the intern was just like the senior Manager in terms of gender and race. And that is the performance maximizing condition. That condition is better than all the other four conditions in the experiment. And we find a similar effect on the probability of so I showed you the probability of receiving a job offer on this slide and the weekly performance on this slide, same effects. So in short, randomly meeting a senior manager just like you has a strong positive effect on weekly performance and the probability of getting a job offer. And then the question becomes why? So to understand that why question, we conducted a deep qualitative survey and what came out was that lots of information and advice that normally would not be shared was shared in these water coolers, especially the senior manager water coolers. So it's just like meeting someone in the hallway. The only difference is the intern normally would not meet the super senior Manager in the hallway, but in the remote workplace, you can make that happen and that has an effect. So that's the experiment. You can read more about my research in my Harvard Business Review article, which was the COVID story from November December 2020 entitled The Work from Anywhere Future. And I would love to stay connected with all of you. And this is my Twitter handle. Thank you so much.",

        "transcript_text": "This next session is going to be packed with actionable ideas that you can take back to your teams about how to approach the move to remote work. These insights come from Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States. Back in May 2020, when the world had been thrown into the largest remote work experiment, Coinbase's leaders quickly recognize that the future of their work was remote first. So in a few moments, we will welcome to the stage two of the leaders who helped the company navigate this transformation. Dominique Baye, who oversees the employee experience, belonging, inclusion and diversity. And HR enablement functions at Coinbase and daisy Linden, the director of employee experience, who stewards the company's transition from in office to remote first, leads the workplace experience and remote first teams, and supports cultural change and employer brand work. So, needless to say, we are going to learn a lot from them today. They'll talk us through how to align your executive leadership on a path forward and how to overcome some of the common pitfalls along the way. So please welcome Dominique and Daisy. Hello, everyone, and welcome. My name is Daisy Linden, and I'm here with my colleague Dominic Baye, and we're talking about how Coinbase went remote first over the last 18 months today. So thank you so much for joining us in today's conversation. We're going to dig into things like why it matters that you have a good reason for going remote. We're going to talk about design principles to help you shape the journey that you take if you decide to go more remote or remote first or remote only. And we're going to talk about the big hurdles to remote first that we have experienced ourselves so far. I'll just introduce myself briefly and then ask Dominique to do the same. I am the director of employee experience here at Coinbase. I've been with the company for three years, and it is a big part of my job to think about how we operationalize this big decision we made a little over a year ago to be a remote first company. So, Dominique, do you want to talk about yourself? Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm thrilled that Daisy and I have the opportunity to share our story. Going through remote first, I lead everything related to employee experience at Coinbase, as well as everything it takes to have a high functioning people organization related to people strategy, people analytics, and people technology. And the fun fact about me is that I joined Coinbase in May of 2020, and if you're keeping track of timelines, that's about two months after the world basically went into shelter in place. And so I joined Coinbase in a totally remote capacity. And basically within the first two weeks of me joining, we announced that we were going to be permanently remote first, and we were the first tech company to do that. So happy to share that perspective. Yeah. And I think we'll kick off with just talking about how that decision got made. At the time, just for context, I was actually leading our internal comms function. So that was the scope that I had at the time and how I was touching this decision. But how did we get there? I will say that pre pandemic, Coinbase was a very in office company. We were all about consolidating teams. We really believed they needed to be physically proximate to do their best work. But as we started preparing for what was eventually the inevitable shift to work from home early last year there was a conversation that kicked off among our executive team our et about being remote and the challenges inherent in it. And we actually intentionally started ramping down the number of people who were in office before the sort of government mandated shelter in place happened because we wanted to minimize the shock to the system for coinbase and because we wanted to make sure we could do it in sort of a compliant and a safe way for our customers and for our employees. But as we started doing that, as we reckoned with bullet three here, we have to do this, we kind of realized that being remote wasn't slowing us down. We were still hiring like crazy, we were still building amazing products. We were not losing any of the momentum that we felt like we might have before we were forced to go remote. And so it was this incredible moment of a forced experiment that we had to go all in on and had this opportunity to ask ourselves should we do this forever? Should we stay remote? And to answer that question, we had to come up with the rationale that made sense for Coinbase. We didn't want to just do it because of momentum that wouldn't make sense. So for us, I think what we ended up identifying were three big whys. Three big reasons why it made sense for us to be a remote first company in the future. First was incredible access to diverse talent. Coinbase has as a cultural tenet the notion of top talent in every seat. And the idea that you can only recruit from driving distance around your offices is kind of intention with that idea of top talent in every seat. So being a remote first company would earn us the ability to really get top talent in every seat. Second was alignment with the core principles of crypto, which is obviously a fundamentally decentralized technology. And making a big symbolic move like this I think was in some ways like a statement of our support and belief and commitment to those principles of crypto. And then finally, and not least, was autonomy and flexibility for employees. We have always tried to be a really employee first company where we give lots of autonomy and trust to our people and this felt like an extension of that. So for those reasons we decided that post pandemic, coinbase would be a remote first company. And we didn't know this at the time, but being really decisive, we were one of the very first companies to make this real decision in the wake of having to go work from home for everybody. Being so decisive so early on gave us a ton of space over the last 1812 to 18 months to actually think about what it means to be a remote first company. And that was the kind of the trade off we made. We didn't necessarily have all the answers when we made the decision, but making that decision has allowed us the space to go develop those answers. Dominique. What am I missing? What would you add? Yeah, I think hindsight, it's 2020, and I think you've just put a very beautiful narrative around it. I think as a relatively new person starting and really coming in at the middle of, I think this conversation. I think what was very clear to me was how quickly we as coinbase are able to make decisions if we think they're the right thing to do. It didn't mean that we had figured everything out and we didn't turn over every stone in some deep analytical exercise. But I think we identified pretty quickly, like, what are the key things that would make the decision? Do we think it's true? And then once we made the announcement, the work that was handed off to me was, okay, make this the right decision. We made a bet here, so let's make sure that we can play it out. And that was pretty exciting, kicked off our journey. But I think also, like you said, being so decisive early, instead of hemming and hawing about the right information and how to make the decision, we were able to put all that energy into creating the best future of work for coinbase. So I guess that's one thing that I would share to the audience, which know, you might be in various phases of this. You probably have employees who are just like, clamoring to come back to the office, but there's other employees who probably had a new type of freedom during this time that also don't want to give it up. And in some ways, deciding earlier versus later just means that you can devote a lot more energy into really leaning into the future. And I think that's one of the things we had done. Yes, like you said, you entered the story kind of midway through the conversation, and you were charged with how do we operationalize this, how do we make this big aspiration into a plan? So I'll flip to our next slide. So maybe you can talk a little bit about how you thought about yes, yes. And a little bit more about me and my background coming to coinbase. This is actually the first time I was in a people function or even an employee experience function. But my background is actually much more in, I would call it like business generalist roles. I started in management consulting. When I moved over into tech. I served in a role called BizOps, which is very strategic and operational and then moved into growth and product roles. And so in many ways, not only was I coming in new to Coinbase new challenge, but also sort of a new function. That said, I would say that fundamentally, this work was pretty textbook. Like nebulous large problem that just needs to be structured, broken down into key pieces of work and then executed against. So in that way, it was actually very cool for me to come in and be able to do this. So first things first, we really needed to be clear about our goals and articulating what our charter was. And one of the things that was very inspiring for me and very much in the spirit of Coinbase and our bent toward innovation is in May of 2020, there was just a lot of conversation about how sucky it was to work from home for some folks not having the same benefits at the office and all of that. And when we talked about being remote first, we said, well, we can't just try and replicate what was in the office. We've been doing it for two months. There's no replication for getting coffee in person, but there are a whole lot of other benefits. Not having to commute, having more flexibility on your time, actually not having FaceTime weirdly. And so we set out a charter that was that we weren't trying to just replicate or equalize the remote experience, but actually that we had this opportunity to create a better coinbase and to really lean into how do we take this opportunity to in some ways right the wrongs with the sort of legacy in office structure. And so some of those things, for example, were that before the pandemic, about 90% of our employee base was in the SFB area and 10% were either in global offices or remote. And that 10%, regardless of where they were, felt like they were second class citizens. They didn't have the same access to learning and development that they were sort of this anomaly. And in a remote world or in a remote first world that actually went away, everyone was more on equal territory. So things like that, we really wanted to lean into. And so that was our charter, to be a better version of Coinbase. And then once we aligned on our charter, then it was really about, okay, next step, how do we create some structure on this? Like what are our core principles? And Davey, I think there's another slide here if you want. So we aligned on five core design principles. And again, because we were dealing with such a nebulous problem, we didn't know all of the decision points and we wanted to be able to make decisions quickly without always having to check in with our executive team. And so we aligned on these five design principles to shape all of our subsequent decision making. So the first was about maximizing choice for employees. And as Daisy mentioned earlier, we actually think this is the biggest value prop for Remote First is this idea of offering optionality, offering flexibility. One of the ways I describe this is we again, very much came from an office culture that was, I would say, pretty quintessential, like best in class tech offices. You go in, meals are provided, snacks are everywhere. And that, I think, for the last 20 years, I call this the Google effect that's become the norm of what it means to offer a best in class experience. And when we said we were going into Remote First, we realized, gosh, we can't rest on the laurels of having this dynamic office. So we have to offer something else, and that something else is optionality and flexibility. Be able to work where you want to work. The second design principle was because we were going to continue to have both offices and people working from home, we knew that there were going to be different experiences, and it was important for us to build equitable experiences, but not identical experience. Like I mentioned, there's no way to replicate an in person meeting virtually as much as we all have tried. It's different, we know that. So that's not what we were even trying to aspire to do. But we wanted to make sure that whether you are working from a home office or coming into the office, that either way, you are having really a phenomenal employee experience and that the choice is yours. The third principle is around ensuring equal access to opportunity, growth and inclusion. And so I think we can all probably identify with either having experienced it or the fear of being a remote worker and somehow winnowing your career opportunities. You're not going to be seen as much. People are going to think you're not committed. There's all of these old preconceived notions about what it means to be a remote worker. And we knew that in order for Remote First to be successful, we actually needed to change the composition of who's coming into the office. If we said we were going to go remote first and 90% of people were still based in the SFA area, nothing was going to change. And one of the biggest blockers to making people really feel comfortable that they could move to Cincinnati, Ohio, and still have the same career opportunities was to make sure that they understood that we didn't see that as stepping back or caring less about work. Just because you want to maybe make other decisions in your life that's good for your quality of life or well being. So making sure that this was true and ensuring equal access was pretty important to us. Still is. The fourth design principle was around letting the culture drive the decisions we wanted to make. And so this is really when tackling remote first, there's actually so many different decisions you can make with a financial lens. If you wanted to cut costs, you might make certain decisions or if you wanted to well, actually, I think the cutting cost one is probably the biggest one that comes up with remote purse. But really making sure that we weren't making decisions because we were trying to optimize something in the business, but rather that we really wanted to continue to hone and foster this culture. And so really thinking about what's the culture that we want, and then that's what would drive our decision making. And then lastly, this had actually always been a principle of coinbase this notion of trusting employees. But we wanted to make sure to call out and to continue to really cherish that principle. Because I don't know about all of you, but certainly when we first were entering a remote first world, there was a lot of buzz about new software and technology to be able to monitor whether employees were working. I think there's some software to see if people are actually typing on their keyboards or not. Also we had adopted or we soon realized that we were going to do a geo based compensation philosophy which means that we do pay differently based on where you're working and there are all ways that you can imagine employees trying to game the system or things like that. And what we didn't want to do is devote a disproportionate amount of resources to compliance but rather we wanted to continue to have this trust with employees where we would set policies that we thought were the best for the culture and we know, default to an honor code. So those were our design principles. I think they've served us pretty well. I don't know. Daisy, what do you think? Have we stayed true to these? I think so. I actually had a friend ask me when I was telling them about the course of this work whether these design principles are sort of just like window dressing or writing on a wall or sort of socked away in a Google doc somewhere. And I think the reality is we do revisit these quite often and they, I think, have continued to be the North Star for this work along with the Charter as kind of the macro goal. And they're things that I think we can honestly point to with employees and say, this is the future of work that we're building at Coinbase, and these are the principles around which we're building that future of work. So no, I feel great about these. I feel like we did. This was a good early piece of work that we were able to do around. I was going to say, if anything, in retrospect, I now understand how much these have saved us as we were going through the decision making, especially when we were working with so many different stakeholders internally who are probably optimizing from their lens and really allowing us to almost like cut through organizational clutter. Yeah, and talking about the number of stakeholders and partners, it very much does take a village to move a company from in office to remote first. And part of the way that we included a ton of teams really early on was the way that you broke down this big question of what does it mean to be a remote first coinbase into a series of really discrete questions. So maybe we can talk about that next. Yeah, sounds great. So it's always nice to have the theoretical, like, what's the charter we're trying to go after and what are our principles? But yes, as you mentioned, there's brass tax work that needs to happen to actually go from being, again, a predominantly in office culture to being one that is remote. And so pretty soon after this announcement was made, to be honest, the thought in my head was like, okay, shit. Pretty quickly I realized we really need to break down what is this bigger amorphous problem into discrete pieces. And so through a series of brainstorming, Daisy, with you, you were very involved in those early days. We basically distilled this work down into nine key questions and actually one step further prioritized those questions based on, first, what we call P Zero. Priority number one was about the information. We thought we owed it to employees to know right away. And so this is fast forward. This is now June of 2020. We've been remote now for three months. People are starting to want to permanently move to other places in the country. They don't know if it should be a permanent move or a temporary move. And we felt like we owed it to them to tell them, number one, is your job going to permanently be remote? And we actually did find that 95% of our roles will be permanently remote, but 5% were not. So people in that 5% group needed to know that they couldn't permanently move or the repercussions of that. Number two, I mentioned this earlier, but we ultimately recommitted to our geo based compensation philosophy. That's something we had before remote, but we recommitted to it. And so people needed to understand if you were to move to go back to your hometown, what's the comp implication of that? And then three, we also felt like we needed to tell people if there's anything tricky related to things like visas or anything else that would add additional complication to whether they moved or not. So again, I would call those like the table stakes questions that we just felt like we owed it to employees to tell them as soon as possible so they wouldn't be in limbo. And then the next set of questions that we prioritize really had to do with what I would call the new piping of the company. And so that was a perspective on how we create those equitable working experiences. What does it look like in office in the future? What does it look like at home in order to appropriately set expectations and plan for that? Number two, how do we maintain security? I can't underscore how important security is for us. And it's one thing when it's fairly well contained within one or two GEOS. It's a lot harder when you've got basically an infinite number of offices. And then the third is around tooling and documentation and what we needed to support a remote first headquarters, if you will. And so I think when we think about this tier of questions, there's actually a lot of crutches that you have when you're all colocated. You can almost be like a little rougher on the edges with policy or cultural norms because there are a lot of unspoken cues you get in the office. And this piece of work was actually about saying, well, if you don't get the crutch of being colocated, what is the other infrastructure you need? And then the last set of questions, I would say, were really about how do we optimize now within this structure? And so it was about how do we effectively collaborate and connect while working? How do we train and develop employees, especially earlier career employees, where there's so much about apprenticeship that's part of the job. And then lastly, how do we identify and recognize, you know, we were realizing that there are a lot of fears that our employees had about having their work be invisible if people didn't see them in the office, didn't see them working late, they didn't bump into Brian Armstrong in the lunchline. And in truth, that's actually something that I think is actually a problem in the legacy structure. The fact that even if we didn't want it, there was some notion that there was a FaceTime culture. Or on the flip side, if you are like me, a working mom and have to leave at 430 every day, that somehow that that would be a ding. Anyways, all of this is to say, I think, determining what our new recognition signals were going to be to make sure that when people are toiling away in their home offices, that they still feel like their work is seen. So those were our nine key questions and we organized them in three different phases. Doing this and being able to articulate the structure early, I think, gave people a lot of calm and confidence that this decision that seemed like we made relatively quickly actually had some order to it and that we were methodically working through what I would describe as the biggest fears in our employees minds. Yeah, and I think one of the things that was really valuable about the way we structured this work was we actually gave people internal deadlines that we were working to so they knew that on September 1, no matter what, they were going to know about how we were thinking about tooling or equitable experiences. And by I guess it would have been October 1, we told them about our new meeting norms and how we're thinking about recognition for the future. So I think just putting those lines in the sand and if I could give advice to companies who are on this journey, like giving yourselves those internal milestones and even if you don't know exactly what the answer is, going to be by those dates. Giving employees a sense of when they will have more clarity, I think can calm a lot of the noise that you can feel internally, which is a totally natural reaction to that ambiguity of I don't know what's coming next. I don't know what working here is going to feel like in the future. Yes, we pulled together teams to answer each of these questions, or V one of our answers to these questions in the back half of last year. And those teams were comprised of subject matter experts, of natural owners in the organization of passionate employees. And we made sure to have like a voice of the customer on each of those teams. So people who were actually going to be on the receiving end of these answers to make sure that we were not kind of designing in a vacuum. And I say V one because I think this work different for each of these questions, but we continue to iterate. This is definitely a journey of evolution, but that's where I wanted us to go next, which is when we look back on the last 18 months, what are the big wins, what are the big challenges that we uncovered? And since I'm already talking, I'll just share what I think first, which is empowering employees. I think one of the big gaps that we experience with an entirely remote culture is loss of connection, especially because Coinbase has been growing so fast during this time that really wanting to put it in the hands of employees to stay connected with their colleagues. So one thing we did was implement a monthly coffee budget for all employees to expense coffee or boba or whatever they wanted, just for the purposes of connecting with a colleague, maybe someone on their team, maybe someone they've never met before, but really empowering them to continue that sort of investment in relationship making for themselves. And the other one that I think we managed was this is not written down anywhere, but I think Dominique and I and the working team have sort of this informal ship. It at 80% Rule, which the reason I relate this to trust and transparency is because I think we're clear about that with employees. We have been pretty consistent with them, that we're going to share our best guess at this, our best answer as of today. It might change and we probably don't have all of the FAQ answers quite yet, but ask them when you have those questions, and we will do our best to find the answers as quickly as possible. The idea being if we wait until we're at 100% fidelity to ship something, a decision, a new design for comp program or something like that, we're probably taking too long and we've probably overthought something that we should have just tried to put out there and get some feedback on. But Dominique, what would you add? Yeah, you know what's funny? What keeps going through my mind, Daisy, is you keep saying the last 18 months. And I'm like, no, it hasn't been 18 months. But I actually would call that a win. It's easy looking back now and say, oh, this is very well organized and all that, and I think it was. But I do think that being committed to this journey that we're on and having really turned over, I think, the most important stones. I think, honestly, to me, that's the biggest win, that we are where we are and it no longer feels like we're designing a remote first reality, but that we're actually in that remote first reality now. So much so that, Daisy, I think when you joined the team, your role was director of remote first, and we realized that doesn't make sense because remote first is everything now, and so it really is just employee experience. Yeah, well, the one thing I didn't mention on this slide was meeting proliferation, which is probably a whole other conference talk in and of itself. So if you want to talk about meeting overload, you can find me on LinkedIn. But I will just say that I think everyone has experienced this. Going fully remote means more meetings. And so now we're making efforts to wind that back and be really thoughtful about what the occasions are that require an investment in a Synchronous meeting and where our employees and our team should be really focused on async work instead, but definitely a lot to continue to improve there on our side. And that will for sure be an 18 month journey. Definitely. That is probably a forever journey. So we'll wrap up here with our last slide and end on a real high note with what keeps us up at night about remote first. Do you want to jump in first? Yeah. Well, as much as I had just said that we're now in remote first, you and I talk all the time about how the proof is going to be in the pudding when offices have gone back to the old world where they're open. We're going to have some people in office, some people at home, and that's where people are really going to realize that for those people who want to go in office, that that experience is going to be different and it's not going to be the same as when that was the center of energy. And so I. Think we're as well prepared as we can be, but I guess I'm expecting still some growing pains there. I'm going to kick the culture one over to you. Yeah. I think one of the things that I've been talking about with our talent team, because they get questions about this a lot, is what does it mean for Culture to have a company that has grown so much as an exclusively remote company and how has Culture shifted and what are we worried about? I think what we've got going for us is, as a founder led company, I think so much of the culture emanates from the Exec team and from Brian, and I think that will continue to be true. But I think that massive growth has had just as much an impact on our culture as going remote first has. And you can't really discount either of the two. They're both huge shifts for us. And so, yeah, what keeps me up at night is so much of Culture is about communication. How do we make sure that new joiners really understand what they're getting themselves into when they join Coinbase and all of the good and all of the hard and equip managers to underscore that? I think, honestly, it's a communications challenge going forward, and I think that only gets more complex as we continue to scale and scale in new countries where we haven't had historical presence. That's definitely the culture piece. And you were the one who thought of this operational backbone question, so maybe you can touch on that. Yes, I think I have more appreciation for all of the things that happen on the back end in order to fuel a great employee experience. And so I think you and I have really leaned in on the innovations around employee experience, the employee facing stuff, and have realized through this work just everything it takes to power 2000 home offices or make sure that we can ship laptops to all sorts of new countries, et cetera. And so I think it can't be discounted just how much operational change there is on the back end that we hope is going to be seamless to employees, but certainly can't be discounted. Yeah, that's definitely a huge part of this work going forward. And I think the good news is the silver lining of what keeps us up at night, maybe, is the opportunity to build these back end systems to really scale as we go from thousands to tens of thousands of people and maybe just highs and lows of the journey. I can start really quick. Mine are linked. I think the high of this journey is consistently seeing how happy many of our employees are with this decision that we've made. And when we do surveys, seeing comments like, I joined Coinbase because it's a remote first company, or even over the last year, people who are so happy to have spent more time with their kids and with their families than they would have spent in the car driving down 280 or 101 in the Bay Area for a couple of hours a day. So that makes me really feel really good about this journey. And I think the flip side of that is that Remote First isn't for everybody. And while everyone who has joined us in the last, maybe not 18 months, but twelve months has done so with the full knowledge that Coinbase is now a Remote First company, we have hundreds of people who joined the company at a time when the agreement was we're an in office company. And luckily lots of those people are flexible and curious and into this idea, but some of them aren't. And I never want to make things harder for employees than we have to. And so I think it is a bummer that we can't be all things to all people, I guess is my low. How about you? Yeah, well, I will describe a very discreet low and that is when I had to send an email to the company saying that we are planning to close our San Francisco headquarter office. That was a low. Not because I didn't actually think it was the right decision in order to break the mindset of having a headquarters and really being able to leave into Remote First, which was the reason. But again, just knowing that so many people were looking forward to a world where the coronavirus was behind us and they'd be back in the office and I could feel that excitement to return to the world that was. And this was really just almost like the harshest way of saying that world is over and it was a necessary step, but absorbing what I felt like was the pain and disappointment. And so I would call that a low. But for me, ultimately, the high in all of this work is that I truly believe that being a Remote First company is going to allow us to be much more inclusive, much more diverse and really create a place where everyone can be successful regardless of their background. And I think that's the future. I think it has to be the future. And so I'm just super excited about our ability to tap into more diverse talent pools. I personally feel like it is game changing for any working parent to be able to both lean into your career but also be there for your kids when you need to be. And so, yeah, I'm just really excited about the future of work that's being created that's totally different from what we've experienced in the last 20 years. So good and so true. Well, thank you everyone. That's all we've got for today. We've got a link here and we'll also drop it in the chat to our original blog post announcing we were going Remote First, which has some more of the nitty gritty behind the thought process of that decision. If you want to check it out. And of course, we would not be coinbase if we did not end on the note of if you're interested in this journey, if you are interested in coinbase, definitely check out Coinbase.com slash Careers.

        "transcript_text": "Awesome. Well, thank you everyone for joining and welcome to our first session of Release Managers Fire Drills and Chats. So the purpose of this session is to improve the release manager experience by sharing knowledge and skills with others. The examples or discussions set here are basically be scenarios that release managers have faced in the past or discussions about processes that are not 100% clear. Now for this knowledge sharing session to work, participation is required from everyone because otherwise this is going to be a monologue and it doesn't make sense to be a monologue. So I will also appreciate if someone can take notes. That would be great. So let's just get started. So I'm going to read an scenario and then I'm going to ask you the question and then we can start the discussion. Right? So for the first scenario, it is a straightforward one, so let's see how it goes. So we have an S two incident that has been open and it impacts the GitHub.com availability. This incident, the root cause has not been determined. So because of it, the AOC pulls Release Managers to the incident channel. You can read that as the Slack channel or the Zoom meeting and then ask them to help them determine if the root cause is associated with the deployments. So as release managers, what are your next steps here? So what do you do to help? I can jump in. So what I would do is I would ask if it's been identified on any sort of like grafana type charting or if it can be viewed through any of that charting, and then we can look at the overlay of deployments against it to see if it happened to line up. That would be kind of my first inclination of one way to see if it might have to do with a given deployment. Also, I think usually we check the Lots deployment timing with the Steve said, like with the current timing of the incident, usually we check the dashboard to see if the RPS are getting high or whatever, something is down. After checking the timing, at least for me, I also go to check the def in the GitLab in the announcement channel. I check the Latice deployment, then I check the def in the GitLab.com UI to determine if there is an Mr there fishy or something. And this is really hard. I think we need something to basically make it easier for us to actually determine if an Mr is causing the incident or not. Because usually we check just from the UI and this is slow and not very effective, but sometimes it's there really. Also from some incidents I've been into, like I've seen Myra successfully actually checking VMR from the UI and linking. Yeah. Can I interject there? Myra and I talk about this a lot. When Myra does that, Myra is being a backend maintainer. So I think there's a separation of what we expect from a release manager. And so for those of you with SRE skill sets, you will probably be able to do things that as an SRE, with an SRE hat you can do. Those people with backend experience can do that. And I think as a release manager we don't have to do that. We are the experts on the process. You don't have to be able to identify the EBA if you want to see the worst version of both McKelley or I are your worst version of a release manager because we have neither SRE nor backend. We are just coordinating at that point. Yeah, for sure. I totally agree. I think as far as release managers go, it is basically as you mentioned to see, okay, if the Grafana dashboard correlates with a deployment, then find the deployment and take it from there. But it is not expectation from us to say like oh, this is the actual culprit, and then reverse that and then push it. That is not expected from release managers. All right, so to summarize, you mentioned checking the deployment, checking if it matches the Grafana chart and checking the last deployment from the announcements channel. And then what else can we do to determine if this was associated, if the incident is associated with the deployments. What about migrations for example? Do you think migrations could correlate with this? Yes. Also like running the migration could also correlate with this or the migrations that we do not execute that executed automatically. Also maybe it's also the cause. Is there an easy way to tell the EOC like oh hey, this deployment had migrations or like these were the last one executed, they might be helpful. I'm not sure if we have dashboard for it to be honest. But I think for me I check the migration job or the PDM if I executed something. Yeah, I agree. I mean certainly if we recently executed the PDM we would know. But as for the migrations, just running part of the pipeline, the way that I would know of is finding that job in the pipeline, clicking it and seeing did any migrations run, which I suppose does take a little bit of skill in reading the Ruby migration output or the Rails migration output. It's also trickier because of the Cannery stage as well. So you may have an incident, say, in production as you're rolling out in production. And something you have to keep in mind is that those migration for that package has run at the Cannery stage. So hours before and potentially every other package rolling out to Canary from that point, basically from every other package after that one that is ready reaching out into Canary, potentially affected with its own migration. So in terms of production, main stage incident is really tricky to figure out the real state compared to just identifying the deployment pipeline because every other after that could have an impact. Usually it should not because of how the migrations are, the regular migration are designed, but it's worth to keep in mind because we have this shared state. I also wanted to ask, I think we have it documented somewhere that what Alessio just said. I'm not sure to be honest, but I learned this that it runs on the Canary stage from Ruben, because I ask Ruben all the time so he mentioned it to me. So I learned it from Ruben but I'm not sure if it's documented somewhere. Does the migration run actually at the Canary stage? Even if it's production like migration problem? I think it is documented on the development side. I'm not sure if we have an overview of the migration lifecycle in our documentation from the release manager perspective. Yeah, maybe it's not stated out clearly. It's more side effect of what is cannery. So what services runs in Canary and where are the shared state and service? Do you all think it will be helpful to have some sort of way to tell all these deployment executed migrations or not? It could be a nice to have or like a requirement to help us on incidents. You know, those messages that come into coming release, right? If it's not too frequent then we can probably have it so that if a migration runs it sends a message or something like that as a way to keep track of the timestamp as well. Because I think we have annotations for deployments like on Grafana and when we execute post deployment migrations, we also leave a note on the release task issue which is not the same as annotation but it's recorder there. But perhaps there is a gap for regular migrations. Like perhaps we should annotate them as well or post a message on the release tax issue that this deployment triggered this or put a div in the slack channel or something to allow us to find them easily. Have we found incident in the past with this specific behavior? Because what I'm thinking from my experience, so limited to my time zone and my shift as release managers is that often so if it fails at a migration stage is something that we release managers identify and often is the case, then nothing is broken. It's more something like we are prevented to continue with deployment. So if we had to deploy something we are blocked. So there's no outage, that's what I want to say. So usually there's not an outage, it's just a migration partially applied or something broken so that we can't continue. And so we know hahad that this is why not really this is why, but we know that it failed on a migration. We have the job that failed and the job that failed tells us what migration was running and it's kind of an easy entry point into debugging this. Then there is the other thing which is we run post deployment migration and it failed at the post deployment migration stage. Again, same situation. You kind of have a very clear entry point into the issue. And then there are two other situations. One is I had a general failure, say a QA or something like that, and it may or may not be related to the migration just run. But often the case it's the EEOC coming up to the release manager with a clear incident declaration and they already know if it's coming from the database. So usually they're coming with a direct question. So did we have something run on the deployment that affected this table or this index? So this is to answer your question? Yes. Could be useful to have a list of things that change it. But I never found myself in the opposite situation where there was something unknown, something is broken, we don't know what is broken. And I had to figure out if migration were run as just about one of the many inputs to the investigation phase. It was more like something happened. There is an ongoing deployment, I provide the diff. And I would say that's it maybe that's not the case because oh, no, it just gets deeper and deeper. But it's kind of the entry point. So you provide context, you give the diff of things that were running more or less at that time, and then someone with a specific skill set may came back with questions like there were migrations. I mean, they have the diff, so they can find themselves. But that's kind of where the conversation evolved from there, right? Yeah. To expand on your first point, Alessio, it has happened to me that we actually executed a migration that caused a regular migration, that caused an outage because the code was not compatible with the database. Like production was expecting another column and Canary was serving them and then boom. And for that it was an S one. No one was very aware of what's causing it. And then it occurred me like, oh, this has happened before. It is like a miscompatible version. We need to find the migration and try to do something about it and then just restart the application. Regular migrations are also well, the problem was not the regular migration, the problem was the code not bit compatible. Yeah, but it started with the migration and didn't fail at the migration. So that's kind of the thing I was asking. Okay. Yeah. All right, so just to continue with this scenario, let's assume that the root cause was in fact a code change that was recently deployed and we were able to roll back. What will be the next steps here? I would engage with development to get someone working on a fix of some sort if we know that there is a code change. So the dev on call, dev escalation type thing, the reality is that yeah, I would also use my back end skill set to try to help. But I think from the release manager perspective, we should escalate to the Devon call and get development involved and then work with the other people involved in the incident, like the EOC, to determine whether or not we want to consider a rollback as a solution or if we want to roll forward and wait for a fix. In this scenario, we roll backed deployment, so the incident mitigated. So the question will be, like, what will we do next? To resolve the incident or to help resolve the incident? Got you. Yeah. If we did roll back, then we would need to halt deployments to prevent them from continuing and reapplying that problem and then again seek development to work on a fix. And then once the fix is done, we can pick it into auto deploy and then resume deployments with that deployment. Does anyone else have another answer? I'm going to take that silence as a no. So is that process documented, or do we know that from memory? I hope it's in the rollback run book. I'm pretty sure it is. That's quite a good runbook. Okay. Yeah. I know this from memory because it has happened many times, but I'm not sure It should be right. I think it is because I think the problem we generally face with rollbacks is that there's a misconception that as soon as we've rolled back, everything is resolved and everybody goes back to their lives. And I think the thing that we uniquely have to take care about is the fact that that doesn't mean the incident is resolved. We're still blocked. We still need a fix to be merged and deployed. So I think that's why we have I'm pretty sure we have it in that same runbook. I think we have it as, like, a follow up, like, what happens after a rollback, just like because your mileage actually may differ. It depends on the incident. It depends on what happened. But yeah, we have it. Okay. Also, yeah, it's briefly mentioned in the link I just sent it's the last sentence in that section. Following a rollback, the cause of the problem will still need to be fixed. Doesn't say anything about halting deployments, though. Yeah, as much as it mentions another merge request to fix it, I guess it's not very explicit about the fact that we need to halt deployments until that merge request gets picked and deployed. I think that process, at least for me personally, I remember it from memory. Okay. Could be a good one to follow up to see if we can clarify that process as much as possible, because it is a very common one. Who would like that action of open an mr and try and write it better? I was looking if it's in the s one incident procedure. Because if I remember, the rollback was kind of we had another runbook, which was about you have a totalaltage on what do you do? And rollback was part of that. And we kind of extracted and say, this is kind of rollback, because you may want to run rollback for exercise purposes and things like that. So maybe it's there. I was trying to find that link. Before we move on, does anyone else have anything to add for this scenario? I just wanted to mention for this scenario and actually also the first one, that a question which I think as release managers we should just get into the habit of always asking. It's not entirely our responsibility, but I think is a question that isn't asked often enough is, is this thing behind a feature flag? So we do quite often get kind of pulled into discussions can we roll back or does a revert get needed? And sometimes in amongst all of that we forget to ask the is this actually a feature flag that could be turned off? So I would suggest if ever you're asked any of these, just hopefully that's already been answered. But it's a good question to just ask. Anyway, this is in the Rom book that I was looking for. I was just reading from Scarbok. There is a remediation options and one of the point is consult the feature flag log and consider disabling any recently enabled features. Nice. I would follow up given everyone kind of agreed that they remember these things and didn't if it was in the runbook, if this situation came up, how often would you start searching Runbooks? Or how can we improve that habit? That is a good question. I normally do when I know that we have something in there that I don't particularly remember from memory and I go to the runbooks and search it. But searching in the runbooks is not the most friendly option. What I do is to actually go to my terminal and try to grab some keywords and then, oh, this is the page and then I open it on the web. It will be so much better if we have a search option like oh, rollbacks, just take me to that page. But yeah, it is a good habit to have. Yeah, I wanted to mention this as well. Can we add our like as a site, like Dedicated, they have a very just showing the MD files, markdown files. It's easy to search there from the UI more than actually our box because it's not like search friendly. I would say we did a test on this. Basically it means rewriting the whole repo because of links, because of syntax highlighting. So I did an attempt, I think six months, maybe one year ago. Well, it's a huge task, but yeah, I feel the pain. I have a trick of how I search them pretty quickly. I'll share it after and see if that's a helpful tip for anyone. For sure. Thanks, Steve. I have an annoying habit technique. You'll hate me for this, but I'm going to say anyway, which is quite often I know we have a book because I remember editing it. I'm like I've read or written or reviewed something on this. So I would also strongly recommend frequently updating as many of these things as you possibly can because you're like I'm sure I've written something about QA or incidents or labels and that's usually how I go and hunt the thing. I know it exists because I've definitely read or written in. Yeah, just a quick mention that. It. Is difficult to find the runbook. But for me I just generally if I need to look for something, I go to the what's it called, the Docs README and we have a list, right, like that giant kind of like a bookmark list of things that we do as the release team. And generally things are there, but even now I look for a keyword like incident and I get like two results and we have two different guides for even just there's a guide to incidents and then what to do in case of an incident. I think specifically for GitLab.com, but I feel like some of these could be a bit more consolidated because I think a lot of information is repeated. Yeah. Consolidate, please, Jenny. I do exactly what you're doing and I'm like QA. Oh, there's four QA things. So yeah, if you spot chances to cross link or consolidate or improve them, please do. Because I think commonly someone can't find something and we just duplicate. So it's not a deliberate let's write this out lots of times. Ideally it's just one. So yeah, please improve them. I just added an action item for everyone to see. Like if you see any consolidation improvements, just please take 5 minutes to do so because for sure it helps. So we have 4 minutes. I'm not sure if that is enough time to discuss the other points. So I think we should better wrap up so we don't risk to run over this meeting. So we have some action items. Who wants to take the first one about clarifying the steps after a rollback? I can do that. Awesome. Thank you Jenny. And then Steve, just to share the release docs search tip and everyone to consolidate the release docs. And on these 3 minutes left, I'm going to ask you all the question. What do you think about this session? Do you see value of having these recurrent sessions each month? Awesome. Very happy to see a lot of head movement. Well, I have one more task, Myra, for you as a follow up action on this one, which you may have thought about already. But if we do want to make these reoccurring, which I think is a great idea, could you figure out maybe this is a fire drill section on the delivery handbook page or something that makes it discoverable so that people know where to look through previous ones or something. So if I want to know about Rollbacks. I can find this recording, and I know we did a fire drill and kind of reuse this information. For sure. I can do that. I will add it to the issue in which I am taking a lead on this. Thanks very much. Right. Does anyone else have anything to add in these last 2 minutes? I'm going to take that as I know so well. Thank you, everyone, for joining. And well, I will see you around. Take care. Thank you for organizing. Thanks so much. Bye.",

It's also trickier because of the Cannery stage as well. So you may have an incident, say, in production as you're rolling out in production. And something you have to keep in mind is that those migration for that package has run at the Cannery stage. So hours before and potentially every other package rolling out to Canary from that point, basically from every other package after that one that is ready reaching out into Canary, potentially affected with its own migration. So in terms of production, main stage incident is really tricky to figure out the real state compared to just identifying the deployment pipeline because every other after that could have an impact. Usually it should not because of how the migrations are, the regular migration are designed, but it's worth to keep in mind because we have this shared state. I also wanted to ask, I think we have it documented somewhere that what Alessio just said. I'm not sure to be honest, but I learned this that it runs on the Canary stage from Ruben, because I ask Ruben all the time so he mentioned it to me. So I learned it from Ruben but I'm not sure if it's documented somewhere. Does the migration run actually at the Canary stage? Even if it's production like migration problem? I think it is documented on the development side. I'm not sure if we have an overview of the migration lifecycle in our documentation from the release manager perspective. Yeah, maybe it's not stated out clearly. It's more side effect of what is cannery. So what services runs in Canary and where are the shared state and service? Do you all think it will be helpful to have some sort of way to tell all these deployment executed migrations or not? It could be a nice to have or like a requirement to help us on incidents. You know, those messages that come into coming release, right? If it's not too frequent then we can probably have it so that if a migration runs it sends a message or something like that as a way to keep track of the timestamp as well. Because I think we have annotations for deployments like on Grafana and when we execute post deployment migrations, we also leave a note on the release task issue which is not the same as annotation but it's recorder there. But perhaps there is a gap for regular migrations. Like perhaps we should annotate them as well or post a message on the release tax issue that this deployment triggered this or put a div in the slack channel or something to allow us to find them easily. Have we found incident in the past with this specific behavior? Because what I'm thinking from my experience, so limited to my time zone and my shift as release managers is that often so if it fails at a migration stage is something that we release managers identify and often is the case, then nothing is broken. It's more something like we are prevented to continue with deployment. So if we had to deploy something we are blocked. So there's no outage, that's what I want to say. So usually there's not an outage, it's just a migration partially applied or something broken so that we can't continue. And so we know hahad that this is why not really this is why, but we know that it failed on a migration. We have the job that failed and the job that failed tells us what migration was running and it's kind of an easy entry point into debugging this. Then there is the other thing which is we run post deployment migration and it failed at the post deployment migration stage. Again, same situation. You kind of have a very clear entry point into the issue. And then there are two other situations. One is I had a general failure, say a QA or something like that, and it may or may not be related to the migration just run. But often the case it's the EEOC coming up to the release manager with a clear incident declaration and they already know if it's coming from the database. So usually they're coming with a direct question. So did we have something run on the deployment that affected this table or this index? So this is to answer your question? Yes. Could be useful to have a list of things that change it. But I never found myself in the opposite situation where there was something unknown, something is broken, we don't know what is broken. And I had to figure out if migration were run as just about one of the many inputs to the investigation phase. It was more like something happened. There is an ongoing deployment, I provide the diff. And I would say that's it maybe that's not the case because oh, no, it just gets deeper and deeper. But it's kind of the entry point. So you provide context, you give the diff of things that were running more or less at that time, and then someone with a specific skill set may came back with questions like there were migrations. I mean, they have the diff, so they can find themselves. But that's kind of where the conversation evolved from there, right? Yeah. To expand on your first point, Alessio, it has happened to me that we actually executed a migration that caused a regular migration, that caused an outage because the code was not compatible with the database. Like production was expecting another column and Canary was serving them and then boom. And for that it was an S one. No one was very aware of what's causing it. And then it occurred me like, oh, this has happened before. It is like a miscompatible version. We need to find the migration and try to do something about it and then just restart the application. Regular migrations are also well, the problem was not the regular migration, the problem was the code not bit compatible. Yeah, but it started with the migration and didn't fail at the migration. So that's kind of the thing I was asking. Okay. Yeah. All right, so just to continue with this scenario, let's assume that the root cause was in fact a code change that was recently deployed and we were able to roll back. What will be the next steps here? I would engage with development to get someone working on a fix of some sort if we know that there is a code change. So the dev on call, dev escalation type thing, the reality is that yeah, I would also use my back end skill set to try to help. But I think from the release manager perspective, we should escalate to the Devon call and get development involved and then work with the other people involved in the incident, like the EOC, to determine whether or not we want to consider a rollback as a solution or if we want to roll forward and wait for a fix. In this scenario, we roll backed deployment, so the incident mitigated. So the question will be, like, what will we do next? To resolve the incident or to help resolve the incident? Got you. Yeah. If we did roll back, then we would need to halt deployments to prevent them from continuing and reapplying that problem and then again seek development to work on a fix. And then once the fix is done, we can pick it into auto deploy and then resume deployments with that deployment. Does anyone else have another answer? I'm going to take that silence as a no. So is that process documented, or do we know that from memory? I hope it's in the rollback run book. I'm pretty sure it is. That's quite a good runbook. Okay. Yeah. I know this from memory because it has happened many times, but I'm not sure It should be right. I think it is because I think the problem we generally face with rollbacks is that there's a misconception that as soon as we've rolled back, everything is resolved and everybody goes back to their lives. And I think the thing that we uniquely have to take care about is the fact that that doesn't mean the incident is resolved. We're still blocked. We still need a fix to be merged and deployed. So I think that's why we have I'm pretty sure we have it in that same runbook. I think we have it as, like, a follow up, like, what happens after a rollback, just like because your mileage actually may differ. It depends on the incident. It depends on what happened. But yeah, we have it. Okay. Also, yeah, it's briefly mentioned in the link I just sent it's the last sentence in that section. Following a rollback, the cause of the problem will still need to be fixed. Doesn't say anything about halting deployments, though. Yeah, as much as it mentions another merge request to fix it, I guess it's not very explicit about the fact that we need to halt deployments until that merge request gets picked and deployed. I think that process, at least for me personally, I remember it from memory. Okay. Could be a good one to follow up to see if we can clarify that process as much as possible, because it is a very common one. Who would like that action of open an mr and try and write it better? I was looking if it's in the s one incident procedure. Because if I remember, the rollback was kind of we had another runbook, which was about you have a totalaltage on what do you do? And rollback was part of that. And we kind of extracted and say, this is kind of rollback, because you may want to run rollback for exercise purposes and things like that. So maybe it's there. I was trying to find that link. Before we move on, does anyone else have anything to add for this scenario? I just wanted to mention for this scenario and actually also the first one, that a question which I think as release managers we should just get into the habit of always asking. It's not entirely our responsibility, but I think is a question that isn't asked often enough is, is this thing behind a feature flag? So we do quite often get kind of pulled into discussions can we roll back or does a revert get needed? And sometimes in amongst all of that we forget to ask the is this actually a feature flag that could be turned off? So I would suggest if ever you're asked any of these, just hopefully that's already been answered. But it's a good question to just ask. Anyway, this is in the Rom book that I was looking for. I was just reading from Scarbok. There is a remediation options and one of the point is consult the feature flag log and consider disabling any recently enabled features. Nice. I would follow up given everyone kind of agreed that they remember these things and didn't if it was in the runbook, if this situation came up, how often would you start searching Runbooks? Or how can we improve that habit? That is a good question. I normally do when I know that we have something in there that I don't particularly remember from memory and I go to the runbooks and search it. But searching in the runbooks is not the most friendly option. What I do is to actually go to my terminal and try to grab some keywords and then, oh, this is the page and then I open it on the web. It will be so much better if we have a search option like oh, rollbacks, just take me to that page. But yeah, it is a good habit to have. Yeah, I wanted to mention this as well. Can we add our like as a site, like Dedicated, they have a very just showing the MD files, markdown files. It's easy to search there from the UI more than actually our box because it's not like search friendly. I would say we did a test on this. Basically it means rewriting the whole repo because of links, because of syntax highlighting. So I did an attempt, I think six months, maybe one year ago. Well, it's a huge task, but yeah, I feel the pain. I have a trick of how I search them pretty quickly. I'll share it after and see if that's a helpful tip for anyone. For sure. Thanks, Steve. I have an annoying habit technique. You'll hate me for this, but I'm going to say anyway, which is quite often I know we have a book because I remember editing it. I'm like, I've read or written or reviewed something on this. So I would also strongly recommend frequently updating as many of these things as you possibly can, because you're like, I'm sure I've written something about QA or incidents or labels, and that's usually how I go and hunt the thing. I know it exists because I've definitely read or written in. Yeah, just a quick mention that. It. Is difficult to find the runbook. But for me, I just generally if I need to look for something, I go to the what's it called, the docs README. And we have a list, right, like that giant kind of like a bookmark list of things that we do as the release team. And generally things are there, but even now I look for a keyword, like incident and I get like two results and we have two different guides for even just there's a guide to incidents and then what to do in case of an incident. I think specifically for GitLab.com, but I feel like some of these could be a bit more consolidated because I think a lot of information is repeated. Yeah. Consolidate. Please, Jenny. I do exactly what you're doing and I'm like QA. Oh, there's four QA things. So, yeah, if you spot chances to cross link or consolidate or improve them, please do, because I think commonly someone can't find something and we just duplicate. So it's not a deliberate let's write this out lots of times. Ideally, it's just one. So, yeah, please improve them. I just added an action item for everyone to see. Like, if you see any consolidation improvements, just please take five minutes to do so because for sure it helps. So we have four minutes. I'm not sure if that is enough time to discuss the other points. So I think we should better wrap up so we don't risk to run over this meeting. So we have some action items. Who wants to take the first one about clarifying the steps after a rollback? I can do that. Awesome. Thank you, Jenny. And then Steve, just to share the release docs search tip and everyone to consolidate the release docs. And on these three minutes left, I'm going to ask you all the question. What do you think about this session? Do you see value of having these recurrent sessions each month? Awesome. Very happy to see a lot of head movement. Well, I have one more task, Myra, for you as a follow up action on this one, which you may have thought about already. But if we do want to make these reoccurring, which I think is a great idea, could you figure out maybe this is a fire drill section on the delivery handbook page or something that makes it discoverable so that people know where to look through previous ones or something? So if I want to know about Rollbacks. I can find this recording, and I know we did a fire drill and kind of reuse this information. For sure. I can do that. I will add it to the issue in which I am taking a lead on this. Thanks very much. Right. Does anyone else have anything to add in these last two minutes? I'm going to take that as I know so well. Thank you, everyone, for joining. And, well, I will see you around. Take care. Thank you for organizing. Thanks so much. Bye.",

        "transcript_text": "All right, in this week's show and tell, we're going to kick it off with PR and I can't wait to hear what you have to show and tell us about jacqueline, are you here to start? I am, yes. I'm going to represent the corporate communications team. I've got a lot guys there's. Team got to get better at the terms. We've got a lot going on here in the corporate comms world. We conducted a successful 13.0 group media briefing in Japan with five reporters attending. The spokespeople were Brendan O'Leary and Tadashi Marukami. GitLab also introduced. We were included in CRN's, the ten hottest cloud startups of 2020 so far, which is pretty exciting. We are leading up to the announcement of or sorry, I apologize. We announced the Peach Tech and Buzzit acquisitions and the global PR team conducted both embargoed and day of outreach, teasing the key updates to a targeted list of security developer and tech trade publications. We'll have a full coverage report to give to the wider group via the newswire channel today or tomorrow. Overall in our coverage, we had more than 44 pieces of secured coverage across global teams to date, so it's a pretty big deal. We've had seven GitLab media interviews across Google teams to date as move to social media too. So I'm going to cover social media and then executive communications for social media. We did behind the scenes coordination of teams in content, communications, e group, legal and more to come up with our first blog on our first social post that's since the beginning of the month. So we had that go live. That was our diversity and inclusion blog and that's pretty exciting too. That's getting some good attention and really a pretty honest blog. I was really impressed with how that came out. And then Executive Communications is my world, so that one I'm more familiar with. As I read these out this morning, I was super excited. We had Darren on NPR yesterday. Within the last week or so, we had both Sid and Darren on podcasts, on Change Log podcasts. And I have links to all of these too, if you guys want to listen to can. I don't know if we share the links on YouTube, but you can find all these. They're all public, so you can also look them up on the Changelog website looking up their podcast. Sid did the founders talk, and then Darren did change log podcast. And then yeah, I think that's it for Executive Communications and corporate comm. And then it looks like next we have all remote and I'm guessing, Darren, you are representing today. That is correct. Thank you very much. As mentioned above, NPR and Change log went live. I hadn't been on NPR in a while. That was fun to be on. And the segment was actually led by the individual who joined a team's call and became a potato and couldn't figure out how to not be a potato and that went viral. And so that was a great way to kick that call off. And funny enough, now people request that she be a potato in the meeting. So now she has to be a potato in all meetings. So, something for us to consider, if you just make it your thing, you lean into it, you roll with it, you never know. I linked quite a few articles, webinars and podcasts that have gone live this week. They're all there. I've done a couple of consultations with a huge company, over 100,000 people that are going through a remote transformation. And then on the other side of the spectrum, 100 person financial startup. And so it's been really fun to work with these companies and spot and see the differences in kind of the forcing functions that they need to implement and some of the challenges that they're up against. And that makes our documentation better. And there's a couple of follow ups that could come from those, which is pretty awesome. And tonight I get to guest lecture at NCD. They are teaching the GitLab case study on all remote management for the first time to their MBA students. So that's a pretty amazing moment in the history of all remote. And with that, I'll toss it over to Michael. Thank you. I will shortly share my screen. Does it work? Yes. So, the first thing I wanted to highlight is we were doing a German podcast with Tesla. They have been using GitLab Premium and we were sharing basically the story, how they migrated from Jenkins to GitLab. And the nice thing is that they also tweeted about it. So we actually shared the recording, which is in Path factory already. And the next things will be to use the content, the German content, all the assets, and combine it together and use further on that. The good thing is we kind of learned so much in the webcast, so I could talk all day about it, that we maybe will be doing another webcast on specific other topics and I asked them. Both Connie and Greg joined the webcast to contribute to my German coffee chat, which I call the Everyone can Contribute Cafkin and they both joined and we had a great time, which is also my second point. I'm really enjoying it because it's just 1 hour of technical social chat, no agenda, maybe an agenda. So we are just keep using what's already there. So the website is built using GitLab CI CD using GitLab pages. We are kind of creating a blog right now. We're also blogging about what's going on. So this is for example a summary I blocked yesterday about the recording which we are uploading also to GitLab Unfiltered on YouTube. There was also a highlight about handbook first. So someone found a recording from Darren on the YouTube Unfiltered channel and then we discussed about it, shared opinions, shared experiences, was really nice. The only problem is that it's in German, but I can also translate for everyone if needed, so that shouldn't be an issue. Yeah. And the other thing is, we're also organizing everything in GitLab, so we've created a group for us. And that's super nice. And the last thing, I did some social media analytics this week, so I did take a break lately for two weeks, which was really nice. And I kind of reached 2072 followers by today, which means an increasement by 400 followers when I joined GitLab in March. And I think that's really awesome. And with that, over to Emily Jin. Thank you. I am delighted to announce that our Universal Remote podcast is live as of two weeks ago. Two and a half weeks ago. We now have the podcast embedded in the webcast page. We have three podcast episodes. We have nine webcast episodes. There's a lot of great content and it's cranking along. So a huge thank you to all the people who have suggested great guests, of course, to Darren and Jessica for hosting these episodes and to Erica for providing really great editor partners who we trust. And we can just hand off all the great information to our podcast will shortly be on several different platforms. But we submitted to Apple podcasts, it's live on Spotify. We submitted to Stitcher and Pandora. And also there's so many directories of podcasts. I did not know this was a thing. Also the CFP for GitLab commit virtual closed on Friday. We got 160 entries, which is very incredible because we had taken a break from our social media promotion. We've wanted to create a really personal and targeted outreach. So great job to everyone who communicated about the CFP process. We already have early acceptances going out for a double handful of humans. So a huge thank you to the CFP Review Committee, who on top of their full time jobs, have been reviewing 160 submissions. So thank you, everyone. And then I think Emily Kyle for Tigu. Yeah, I'll go. Yeah. I just want to say it's no easy feat. We're trying to fill 24 hours. The event is going to run 24 hours. So this is all pretty incredible. And everybody's really been really thoughtful about the process and getting the best speakers and getting diverse speakers, which is really important to us. And our goal was 100 submissions, so we exceeded that. And it's thanks to everybody's hard work on reaching out to people. So really impressed there. Tika is on next call, but I just wanted to say a couple of words. Collision is next week collision from home. And she kind of thought of a really inventive way to get staffing for this event. So we have three talks and they've built out collisions, built out their own kind of custom event platform, and so we weren't able to preview it in advance. And so she kind of had to cobble together a way to get us leads and staffing from this. So she is having all a bunch of SPRs go out there and attend talks and start to reach out to people through their app and bring people back as leads. So I'll hopefully be able to report back in like two weeks on how that went. But I was excited that she was able to come up with something kind of inventive to make it work and get the SDRs involved so they can get more leads and stuff. So really happy with that. She's not on, but thank you, Tegan. Now we're on, I guess. Darren, do you want to kick us off with shout outs or intro them? Yes, I would love to shout out section. The goal here is to express gratitude within our team and across the company to all the folks that were the highlight of your week. So, you know what, I'll add mine after the fact. But big shout out to Emily Chen. She's been amazing in coordinating commit. Remote is a new track for Commit this time, so it's all new to me. And she's made it easy, which is awesome, and we have some pretty amazing submissions and she's been great in helping to organize those. So thank you very much, Emily. Thank you, as always to Jessica for awesome one on ones, just being super empathetic and real and vulnerable. Really appreciate that. And thanks to the corporate marketing leads team, danielle led an amazing offsite, virtual offsite on Tuesday that was super beneficial and it was exactly what my soul needed. So I appreciate everyone that was a part of that and taking the time to do that. And thanks to Jacqueline for all the wrangling and the support on all of the awesome media ops that we have. Thanks, everyone. I just have everyone to thank. I will toss it over to Jacqueline, who's going to read for Christina. Yes, real quick too, I want to add Darren, thank you, because you are so wonderful to work with that it's honestly a lot of fun to help and you're doing such awesome things and every interview you have, you sound like a pro. So it's been a lot of fun. And then I'm going to represent Christina. So Christina wanted to say a very big thank you to Brendan O'Leary for taking the time late in his evening on a Monday to participate in the 130 Japan Media Briefing. And I'll pass it to Emily Kyle. So I think Emily covered a lot of the CFP stuff and all the thank yous, but I do want to make sure that Emily gets thanked because she's obviously kind of spearheaded this and put in a lot of work. And I'm like, hey, we're going to make it 24 hours. And she's like, sure, we're going to do it, I guess. And so it's just rolled with all the punches. So big thank you to Emily, thank you to John, thank you to brendan. Thank you to Sydney. Thank you to Cormac. Thank you to Dan. Thank you to Darren. Thank you to Tracy. I'm listing out all the track leaders. Thank you to Ray. Thank you to Albert Bacar. Thank you to Candice. Thank you to Michael. Thank you to John. Thank you to William. Thank you to Kim. So thank you pretty much anybody who's been involved in the CFP process. Again, it exceeded all our expectations and it's been a lot of hard work and I know the work will continue, but all of our track leaders wanted to add more talks to their tracks, so everyone seems to be really excited. So that helps build my enthusiasm and keep it going. So thanks to everyone. Also to move on from that to kind of reiterate what Darren said. Thank you, Danielle, for planning our offsite and showing your hidden talent for building team bonding activities online. Those were really fun. We were kind of her test dummies for her new experimental team bonding things and they worked. So thank you for that. On to Brendan. Great, thanks. Yeah, I wanted to do a shout out to someone who's not on the call, but it relates to our fantastic PR team so highwire. The folks over there, the other agencies we have, I worked with our agency in Japan for the Japanese media brief that we talked about. Like, I think it's a testament to the PR team, the great people they choose to work with and how they're able to integrate them so well into our environment. It just feels like a natural extension of our team. They get our values, but they help make us better with the things that we couldn't do just ourselves. So huge. Thank you for that. I had been having a great time working with them and collaborating with those teams. Thanks. I'll go next. I want to say thanks to Hugo, Bruno and Romer for supporting our Brazil focused virtual meetup. Last night we started doing local language meetups and it's driven a lot of new folks into our community. We've seen a lot of growth in our virtual meetup group on Meetup.com because of these local language events that we've been putting on the last few weeks. So big thanks to those folks and also thanks to everyone who contributed to the Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging blog post that we published this week. I know that was a big collaborative effort in a lot of ways, but special thanks to Sarah Cassavian, who is the author of those posts. I think that it meant a lot to our team and our community to see how GitLab plans to take action. So thanks for everyone who contributed to that. And on to Michael. Yeah, I wanted to say a big thanks specifically to Will and Kristen for helping align with the social media strategy and everything which was going on. So I personally had a really rough time keeping up with everything and it was a little too much, and both helped me with their careful comments and making me a little more stable. And I'm back to social media, which is a good feeling. The other shout out goes to our community advocates because I think they're doing an amazing job with all the negativity and all the emotions out there which are going on, and it's like doubled down on everything. Just wanted to say keep up the good work and shine and smile, and we can just master that together. Thank. That's everybody. Did anybody forget a shout out that they're now thinking of that they really want to get in here? All right, we're going to switch to town hall, although I don't see any questions. Are there any questions? Is anybody like, I really want you to stop the recording, and then I'll. Ask a juicy question. Well, I will stop the recording really quickly.",

        "transcript_text": "You. Hey, welcome to the Inbound marketing team weekly recap and demo day. It is Thursday. Yeah, it's Thursday, February 18 of 2021, and we're going to get started with moments of insight. So this is something where we're sharing something we were surprised to learn this week that might benefit others, could be about life work, customers, product leadership, coding, anything. And I think I am actually first up here. So I wrote this in the agenda last week. I was just thinking, or feeling, I think feeling is more accurate about what Handbook First really feels like for me as I've been joining and onboarding. And soon that will be less true and I will just no longer be fresh and new. But as I was a month or two ago, I was really excited about Handbook First. It was super engaging to me. I like to write, I like to read, and I spend a lot of time in markdown files for documentation as it is. So I was like, cool, this is going to be a great way to work. And then I think I hit some road bumps as speed bumps as I started to sift through all of the stuff. Like being Handbook First means that everything is there and curation is hard and navigation can be challenging by the nature of the volume. And so I was like, okay, here are some harder parts about it. And I was like, I don't know what to do with this. And then last week I was finishing up, I was reading one of the book recommendations from the handbook, High Output Management. And they were talking about Matrix organizations. And the book, which I know inspired a lot of the GitLab organizational philosophy, was like, matrix organizations are good. And I was like, wait, hold up, GitLab? So they weren't, I wonder where this divergence came from? And then I was like, okay, cool. I'll just control F through the markdown files and look for matrix organizations. And I found it. And I found not only the handbook entry, but I found a video recording. And this was something about Handbook First that specifically I'd been struggling with about all the video recordings. I don't learn super well by watching a video. It's not my first thing to do. And so I've been like, oh, there's all these videos that I feel like I'm never going to watch. But then I had a very specific application where I was like, I really do want to hear Sid talk about this because I know that it's like a divergence from what I would expect. And so I think just like the thing that I learned here very specifically know, I got this resolution on how Handbook First plays out. And sure, there's a flood of information, there's a lot of it, but it's there when you need it and it's very useful when you've got a specific question in mind. I got this answer. I didn't have to stop anyone's day. I didn't have to start a whole conversation in Slack. I certainly could have if I wanted to, but there was a video of people talking about it, right. And so it was 15 minutes. Answered my own question, learned some more stuff and that's also moments of insights. Learned a whole bunch about GitLab's approach to Matrix organizations or avoiding them and why. But yeah, this was just like, really it was very salient for me, getting a practical exercise and how this plays out. And I think it hits home for me because of the technical documentation that I spend so much time in is like, you wouldn't read technical documentation from COVID to cover. I mean, you could, but it's better if you've got a goal in mind, right. You get more out of it. So, yeah, just learning and feeling that someone has a bullet point under me. Brand gap, but I don't know who it is. I forgot to put my initials. But hello, I have something to share about the brand gap. I have some slides there if you don't want to buy the book, but it's essentially trying to figure out how to connect business decision making to design and strategy. It's really interesting, especially if you work either as a business person or as a creative. But the big takeaway for me is what a brand is and trying to define what that is. And I like their classification of figuring out that it's a person's gut feeling about something. And it makes a clear differentiation that a brand lives with the people's in the customer's head more so than what you say a brand is. I find that very insightful. There's a lot of little things that you can do to figure out what that is, but I just find that way of thinking about it very tangible and I like that a lot. It also, I think, helps elevate creative thinkers to think more with a business mindset, and it helps kind of align those two things together. I recommend reading that book, reading the slides. I link them in our agenda. But yeah, that's it for me. Off to Danielle. Thanks, Javi. That looks like a great one. I want to read that. But remember, everyone, you can expense books for work, so please do continue to learn. It's awesome. Great. I have the metrics section today, so it's the beginning of the quarter. I'm going to go ahead and share my screen so we can just make sure we've all seen the same info. So, first of all, I've linked to the parent Epic. I'll make sure to link to this every week. But this is the parent Epic we're using to organize all the marketing. OKRs? And I want to shout out to Becky and Michael, who are both not on the call today for various reasons, but they worked really hard to help us get a good structure here that would work. Cross team. And I think we know we're still iterating on this, but one of the things we really wanted to do was move away from having key results and metrics kind of at the top level and instead having themes. Because for other people and other teams when they read this, it's a little hard to understand why we would care about inquiries or website traffic if you don't understand what our objectives are. So this is organized in a way that's meant to be more user friendly across the company. And if you haven't read it, it did get reorganized right at the beginning of the quarter. Take a moment to check this out. This will help you understand the context when you get requests from other team members. We've also done a little bit of a revamp for the metrics, so we have two key results. One is around inquiries and the other one is around traffic. So just as a refresher, inquiries are email addresses that are unique. They're different from MQLs because it is possible that an inquiry wouldn't qualify. We use lead scoring here, and so it's possible that we wouldn't want to say that an inquiry is marketing qualified and this team doesn't have quite as much control over that. So Demand Gen currently owns the qualification criteria, which is great. So so far we are just absolutely crushing it. Our goal for this month was 9183 inbound inquiries. We're already at 7399 with over a week left in the month, so we're on pace for 137% attainment, which rocks. Love to see that trend continue because the goals are going to go up. So we want to get that momentum. New Trials I'm going to break this out because this is a screenshot from a bigger dashboard and they're all linked here, but this is a company level visible metric now. So in addition to us caring about inquiries, the company wants to make sure we're healthy on trials. And anyone here who's been part of hunting down brokenness in trials knows that when this breaks for a few days, everybody kind of freaks out. So we want to have a lot of attention on it. This links to a beautiful dashboard. I'm just going to take a moment to highlight. Tod also highlighted this in his presentation just before. But if you hit the back button and you go to the dashboard this is coming from, this is quite a labor of love because every single one of these has to be charted and it has to be tested or against all our different data sources. But even more importantly, you can break this out by the part of the business. So each part of the business has its own metrics. So you could say, I want to understand just PubSec or any of these filters. I probably shouldn't spend a ton of time on this, but I could say I want to understand just growth in PubSec and then I can see a completely new view. Anyone who's built these dashboards before knows this is just really challenging to get right. And also this gives all of you the ability to really deeply understand our business through metrics. So just want to make sure you know, this is here and available to you. We are also on track. This little blue dot, it's a little hard to see here, but is the pace the target to date? And we are just right there at that, which is awesome. And then down to web traffic. I've got two different screenshots for you. The first one is around overall website traffic. So our goal is still to increase overall traffic 20% year over year, not just inbound. And so if we look at overall, we are a little bit behind pace and this needs attention. Unfortunately, we don't have quite as much control over the non inbound channels, so that's more of like partnership with other teams and a conversation that we can have with Dunk and with the man gen. But I do want to point out that inbound traffic we are very much on track at plus 19.4% year over year and I think we're matching and exceeding more months than we had in the past. The blue line is the current year and the orange line is the past year, so we'll see if that continues. I think the SEO changes that we've seen, the improvements there are hugely impactful and that's probably the biggest driver. And lastly, I just want to highlight there is a beautiful blog metrics dashboard that Vicki and Rebecca and I think some others have been working on and it has a very cool new metric available inside of it. So in addition to knowing top blog posts and overall blog performance, we can see the trial submissions that are associated to each one of these posts. So we can understand which posts are actually driving inquiries and helping us understand things we might want to double down on. So for example, it looks like this is a product announcement and generated a lot of trials and so we might start thinking like, oh, each time we have a product announcement post, that's a juicy opportunity to help us hit our goal. So all of these are linked in the agenda doc, so you can check them out at any time. And going forward, I probably won't always be the one giving the metrics update, but those are the metrics that will update throughout the quarter. And with that I will hand it over to Suri to lead show and tell. Hello everyone. Welcome to your favorite portion of this call the Show and tell section. Today you will be hearing from Val first. Val, all you. Hey. And I thought it was going to be all you. Surrey. Wait a minute, so this is Surrey and I have a little partnership going and wanted to let you all know to get ready for something fun that we really haven't done before in content marketing, which is we are doing 62nd videos that answer the burning questions of the day, like what is a DevOps platform? Because you all know that you stay up late nights wondering to yourself, what the hell is it? So we have the fabulous Surrey as our on screen presence and she is going to be answering questions like what is fast, what is Dast? What is GitOps? What is a DevOps platform? In these 62nd videos that we will be sharing on social, you'll find them on the topics pages, they just will be popping up everywhere. So this is kind of a Val Surrey sort of off the books project, but Surrey, we've come up with a great phrase. This is Brie's favorite thing, 60 seconds with Surrey. So anyway, get excited because we're excited and can't wait to show you guys this. We just at this point are in the script writing phase. I think Surrey linked the scripts there. So you can take a peek at our fabulousness, our screenwriting fabulousness because you guys didn't know that we all have like a know other career where we're famous and writing screens like that kind of thing. So anyway, moving on, I'm done, I don't know who's next. Surrey, back to you. Thank you. So just really quickly, this is all Val's brainchild, so the idea of doing 62nd videos is all her. So thank you so much Val, for having this new idea for the content team. Jess, please tell us about tree testing user research. Yeah, let me just share my screen. So we're planning on doing some updates to the navigation design wise, and I figured it'd be a good time to actually see if the information in our navigation makes sense to our customers the way that it's formatted right now. So just something called tree testing. And this is it right here. Basically they have a task, it's something really simple. So if you want to test drive the GitLab product before purchasing it, where would you find that? And they start the task and they can kind of go through our navigation and kind of find it. And so this is what I linked into the doc and this is the results of the first round of navigation testing. And basically these are all the twelve questions we asked. You can see the red ones are ones that didn't go over very well. People weren't able to find those things. The ones with more green were easier to find. And so what we can do with that information, you can actually drop down and analyze them even more. So like this first one, people were really struggling to find GitLab professional services. And if you open this pie tree here, it'll show you something like this. So we can see the happy path is the screen path, but only one person got there and people are really struggling to find that specific thing. And what you can do with that is you can see where the first thing that clicked was. So there's ways to say like, okay, everyone seems to think this thing belongs in resources, but when they get there, it's not there. So maybe that's where we should move it. Or if it is in resources, they might click there, but they still can't find it. That maybe it's not warded correctly. Maybe we need to rethink about how it's worded. So I took all the analysis from the first round and developed another navigation just to test out. Ran it last night. Some things went better, some things went worse. So we'll still have to kind of iterate on this. But just as an example, in the first round of testing, we asked people, if you're working from home, where would you find information on working from home? And we wanted them to find the all remote section. And a lot of people said some people were able to find it, but a lot of people were like, I wish this was just said, like, working from home or something similar to that. So in the second iteration, I called it working remotely and it went from 40% findability to 90% findability. So just that small tweak was able to find a lot more information. Just check the chat real quick. Anyway, so that's it for me. And I'll have more information as we go down the weekend, kind of get it all sorted out. Thanks, Jess. That was so interesting. Tyler, let's look at your demo. Cool. That was so just I'm going to take some of my time to say that that is awesome. And I'm also going to show so here's what I got. I've been working on this so I am working on the blog template that we're putting together that Tina designed. And the big thing that I'm doing, the thing that I want to show is how I'm building this out. I'm going to do high level overview, but I'm going to do a more detailed deep dive for developers to show how I'm conceptualizing using slippers to build our design system in storybook and in an isolated space and what the integration looks like. So what you can see here is the Figma file. Thank you for all of this. Excellent documentation. And in Figma you can see there's these different pressure tests, different blocks, different viewport sizes and variations. Right. Tyler, are you supposed to be sharing your screen? Am I not? Oh, no, you're not. Okay, thank you. Oh, you like there it is. Okay. It highlighted and then I didn't confirm it. So here we are. I'm sharing the screen. Now, this is the Figma file. And as you can see, there's like a bunch of different variations which are super useful. Right. One of the challenges with building out these variations, especially if you're building it into the live site, is that you have to contend with all the stuff going on the live site. It takes a long time to live reload and deployments can be a little bit there's like other stuff going on, right? And we really want to look at all this in isolation so we can use Storybook and we've previewed this before. But this is a branch I have with some additional stuff. So I'll zoom in on sort of the top part here where you can see these SVGs and the breadcrumbs and the header. And so as I've been working this, I said, okay, let's split them out. Those are their own components. And so I have these I called it decoration, right? And I can define different stories. So here's the default here's. Background two, background three, breadcrumbs with different this is for the pressure test two. This would split into two rows on mobile, which we can play around with here, right, which is pretty cool. All of this is fully defined by us and it gives us these. The nice thing is it spits out this HTML, which is portable. So what's going to end up happening is we can port this over into whatever templating makes sense to use on about GitLab.com. Eventually we'll be able to just directly integrate it. So all the work that happens here will also end up in the marketing site directly. For now, as an intermediary step, we get the components that we need in a way that is consumable by the marketing site in an easy way. It sort of forces us to think in good software engineering practices. It forces us to isolate these things to make them do one specific thing. And I'll show you where it comes together. So we'll have these templates and you can see I've got this decoration here, I've got the breadcrumbs and then I've got sort of the start of the title block that you would see there. And then what you're looking at on the right side is just the code for this template. And you can kind of see what you see in this HTML matches a little bit here. These are the components. The nice thing is this SVG is like a bunch of stuff in the markup, but it's a one liner in the template. And so if I wanted to drop another decoration here, but I wanted to make it say like decoration number three, it shows up right there. So we can do a lot of playing around, a lot of demonstration. We get the ability to access these in controls as well, so you won't have to necessarily edit code. So designers, what I'll end up being able to do is I can come back to Tina and say, hey, let's compare these. We can tweak the settings in the storybook. And this is all live on the Mr and the View app. And there's so much more. I am like the mayor of Stokes Lahoma on this. It is so exciting to me. So I will stop and give back the time to the next folks, which is Tina. Thanks, Tyler. I'm super excited to see this come to life. So I'm going to share my screen. Yes, I'm sharing my screen. So this is a new page design for solutions, landing page template for continuous integration. You can take a look at the figma file, which is linked. So you'll see a few new design components here, some improvements on our cards, and this page will be replacing this page. So a huge refresh in terms of design and in content. And speaking of content, I just wanted to give a shout out to Ash. She did a lot of the content work on this, the structure, the wireframes, and shout out to Brand also for giving us all these assets to work with because it really helps put the page together. I'm going to stop my share. That was it. I'm leading shoutouts. There's no one after me. No. So, on to shout outs. So this is an opportunity to express gratitude within our team and across the company to people who were highlights of your week. Who's first? Tyler? Lou. So my shout outs go to both Brandon and Becky. Brandon specifically put together some really great Sprint boards, kanban boards for Digital Experience team, which is making it so much easier to use issues and use boards and dog food, the product like we ought to be doing. And I've already learned so much more about the product and it's been great. I'm no longer using my other task management software. I'm basically ready to go all in on GitLab for my day to day task management stuff with this. So thank you, Brandon, for doing that work. And extra thank you to Becky for all the education on how to get that. Really, really appreciate it. I dropped a link to the process video that made a lot of things click for me, and that just awesome. Transformative. Up next is Danielle. Awesome. Yeah. I just want to shout out to two folks who aren't here because they're being awesome as CEO shadows. Lauren and Shane, you are doing a great job. We see all of your work in the CEO and CEO shadow of Slack rooms. We miss you and you represent us so well. Next up is Javi. Just wanted to quickly shout out Tyler. I link a lot of things in Slack, a lot of content. He actually goes out and do the things that I talk about that I'm too early in my career to actually implement. All the things all the way. So it's awesome to have someone to talk through those things, which has been very rewarding for me and I think rewarding for the whole team in general. So we're happy to have you. All right, well, that takes us to the end of the agenda. Thank you, everyone. Have a wonderful rest of your week and we'll see you all next week. Bye.",

        "transcript_text": "I can record and we don't have a ton of items to get to, and I might be able to do one that might be fun if we have a little bit of time. So corporate events, I think I saw a little I put this in Slack and I saw a little bit of kind of noise around it, which was good. The nutshell here is, as we've kind of restructured and tried different things, the event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be. So the current tactic that we're going with is go to market team signs up and kind of sponsors that event. So you support as a PMM, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. I don't see anyone in the maybe there are comments in the issue. I don't see the header updated yet. I thought we had in Slack sort of farmed each one of them. So it looks like Ty put in some folks. It looks like this looks the let's see. Need support from GTM teams. So I guess the ask would be to work with your it. I saw some Slack, I think, in our Slack, but were you all able to connect with your GTM teams on. Slack only and on the issue? Actually, yeah. Same not in real time, but source feedback. I got one person to respond so far, so it may end up Cindy being you, and I just picking the one that we want to do and then they can back us up. If. We don't get any more feedback. Yeah. Does anybody have a regular sync still? Are those all been canceled or is there. Yeah, we're on like the two week cadence. Okay. Yeah, GitOps has been canceled after the enablement. Cool. So I'm just trying to catch up with the thread so it looks like maybe platform on Reinvent, CI, CD on Google Next and GitOps on KubeCon. Does that sound yeah. Yep. That's where we were last I heard. Cool. So then I think we can help the corp events do they do a lot of cat herding and keep on tracking people down? So I think if this team can take the mission to try to help track that down so if you get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, we're signing up for KubeCon. Can you comment on the issue that, yes, I can commit to this, et cetera, et cetera, et that just so that they can get that event support. But that looks good and I appreciate thanks for the link too, samia on the Rolls product announcements. So I appreciate Brian for adding this. I probably should have added it, but. I had two questions about that one. One is over what time frame are we looking at? In theory, this could be the same as the GitLab 14 launch, where we're saying basically since 130, what kind of big improvements have we made? Candidly, this is always a little bit tough. I am not totally sure of all of the kind of the interplay here, but I think this is kind of the general Gist of this assignment is, okay, we have commit coming up. We have a stage, a metaphorical stage to say something to the world. And we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event. Right. What kind of announcements do we make at GitLab? It's really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire roadmap is completely public. Yada, yada yada. So the thought here is to but also because our entire roadmap is completely public and because we ship these tiny little NVCs, a new feature will come out, but it'll be not really usable. Right. So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say, okay, what started in the last year but now is really like a full fledged feature. What would be coming out of beta? Right? Like, if we were any other company and we started a beta program in this last year, what would we be announcing as ga at the that's kind of my thought on it. I see a couple of head nods. What do you think, Cindy? Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things to say, like vulnerability management, because there were tiny little MVCs all the way along. But if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this, it makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual little thing. And then the other point was we just had 140. Can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here? Absolutely. Yeah. And vulnerability management was one of the features out of we looked in 140. So I think, yeah, this is like, let's take the stuff from fourteen zero and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press or give our PR team this is kind of like input into our PR team to give them Fodder to go out with. And are we trying to hit three per stage? Yeah, ideally there's just three items per stage. And then I think you all made some good notes that, okay, we need to add manage. So I see manage in here. That's excellent. And integrations, we don't well, actually, we have some pretty exciting integrations. The Jira stuff is pretty good. There's a couple of things in integrations with Vs code that could be notable, but can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it? And if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick. I was going Cindy's direction here, which was of and then I call them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things, like three or four per each as key iterations. But I called them something overall. So we would have like one thing to call them. There are several key iterations aligned with Getaway cluster, several that roll up to a research based user experience. And I was thinking like I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket, except that actually that's super typical, right? Like Windows Eleven or anybody who's rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things and then they mention a laundry list of stuff that aligns to that. So I forgave myself for doing something. At first I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing some things there, but actually when I looked around, that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And in terms of the excitement level, that also I went in thinking this is just a two. I guess part of it is like I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken and that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about. But actually some of that stuff is really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I wasn't sure exactly where to place things, but I figured I wouldn't like to Cindy's comment have something that's a one here anyway. But the only way I could make sense of the iterations was to bucket them as something and so that's kind of how I came down on it. I don't know what everyone thinks about that. I like that. Go ahead. No. I've taken a similar approach for monitor with incident management. There were a bunch of things that we released, although the core of Incident Management was part of Twelve X, I think. So I did the same over there as well. I think that makes sense. Yeah. And that would help me with the plan stuff as well because there are some things like epic boards that people have been asking for for years now and they finally have and that's great. But I think the milestone burn up charts, that was a two and that's helpful. And I was looking through features and actual monthly features that were released in a given month. I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but it's not very exciting, but we can bundle that with some other things and up level it, so that would be helpful there. And also, Brian, about the Vs code thing, one other cool thing about that is both of those Vs code integrations that hit the same month were community contributions, which is also kind of. Is do we have Vs code listed on here? I didn't add it, but I can add that in. I've got good notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official was kind of one of the things. But there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that. I think that's a pretty good note as well. We did that with our TerraForm module right there. Was like a community module, but now it's officially supported. So that can be the line yes or no, whether you can use the thing for a lot of businesses. So I think that's a good one too. How are we measuring excitement levels one, two and three is there. I was looking at maybe Mau as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that are interested in using that or not. We probably may not have it for everything, but at least some of it, wherever we have it, it's probably something we can use. But of course we need a benchmark level of what Mau we want to call one, two or three. I think it's a little bit of a judgment call. For example, Cormac was saying like Epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time now, depending on how it's asked for, maybe that means it's exciting or it's not right. But usually when something gets a lot of upvotes or when there's a lot of demand for it, then I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Certainly if something shipped and a lot of people are using it, the Mau, that's another good measure. I don't know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think it's a bit of an individual judgment call on just like what is your feeling based on? Could be anecdotal like you talk to customers and they're really hyper excited about this or maybe not, which is okay. I think it's okay. Harsh responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about having them sort of stack ranked. Yeah, I might even constrain it as we're not going to highlight Loke segments, but we want to see the full spectrum, especially in the case we have slim pickings. Alternately, if there are double digit entries then we can stack rank. So that's kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these, it looks like we're going to get there and that's going to be quite a lot of features. So I might constrain it like this. Maybe you can only give out one, two or three and treat it as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't necessarily. Hard to somebody's, 3 may be more important than somebody else's one agreeing upon them. I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year from Create and there are at least a dozen things that I'm not mentioning that could be on the list. Like I could give you ten things instead of three. Give this just like the rough pass and like a lot of things recently I've been moving between Docs and spreadsheet and the spreadsheet to Docs, this might end up or some iteration of this might end up in a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank in PR. It's like, okay, out of all of the there's maybe ten boxes here and three each. Out of the 30 items, which are the top five? Actually, let's actually just do that. Let's just do this. Like top five overall. This one is PR driven to some degree. What about like a newpan Christie's product keynote at Commit? Are we dovetailing this with that? So this is exactly where this is headed to, is the idea that during the product keynote and then ideally during Sid's keynote as well, that there's some level of an announcement that we make that then the press cares about that announcement. Again, really tough to do at GitLab because it's all been around for a while. So this is our attempt to head to that area is to say these are the announcements of the event. And yeah, maybe it's some things that have been around for a while, but now they're at a level of maturity. Now there's a reason to be excited about this. So that's kind of where it's coming from. So I put a top five overall. Maybe we can just. We should reserve a spot for plan, but I'm going to have to go through and do some Aggregating after this. Just go through the list of what's shipped in the last twelve months and rebucket that. So maybe we can do like 5 minutes. Kind of like just time box and kind of look at these here. What do you all think would be a top five out of the list of 20 or 30? I would say if UX does end up being a flag that we fly. That's an easy one because there's more than just maps to the create stage that would be considered UX improvement. Okay, what else? We need to have a security one in there. We could have either vulnerability management or what I've been struggling with a little bit is I'd like to kind of group some of the proprietary scanning without making it sound like they're scanning improvements because that sounds like they weren't good before. Yeah, let's go with vulnerability management for now. And I would agree on that one. And I would say that some of these we did do some press around and the Fuzzing acquisitions was one thing, so we might not get old. We did the Fuzzing acquisitions a long time ago. Was it within the past year or longer? I thought it was within the past year. I think it was in the last little over six months or so. It was last summer, right? Or something around there. It was like last spring or summer. And then we did another set of press around the integration of it because the PR team liked all the I mean, we got a lot of attention on the acquisition, so they had me do a follow up on the integration. I just feel like it's kind of worn out now. Right. That's what I was saying is that the fuzzing we already did press on, so we probably will not get another chomp at that. So I think let's go with vulnerability management. Unreview. Well, we also have in terms of proprietary stuff, we replaced one of our scanners with Semgrip and we have our own proprietary Dast scanner. Now that's in beta called browserker. So it's our answer to scanning single page applications, which represent a unique challenge. If I could have two, it would be vulnerability management and berserker probably okay, Semgrip. That get picked up as a line item in a couple of the pieces about get back 14. Which between the proprietary ships and the vulnerability management, which would you pick as number one out of those two? Probably vulnerability management. Okay. I'm just kind of scanning the list. I would probably say like Kubernetes Agent is something that we've made a lot of investment in. Although. I think the Kubernetes Agent and from an integration point of view, perhaps the TerraForm integration, I think we have a lot of customers actually using that already. I'm just going to call this GitOps and I'm going to put like KS Agent plus Keshe Corp integrations. It's like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about. Yeah. Cool. Well, this is due Tuesday. I think we want to try to get this done. So maybe just review this kind of like let's just kind of pick top five. Maybe something from Plan and something from CI. CD pipeline editor is definitely an option for CICD. Yeah, there might be a no, sorry. There might be a value stream analytics story in there too. If we aggregate it all. It's a bummer that customizable value stream analytics is twelve nine. But yeah, there might be. Cool. I'm going to ping you on this cormac to add a top five plan. I think that's a pretty heavy list just looking at it. It's pretty cool. Yeah. And this is something we don't do, which I agree, we don't often stop as a company and just kind of look at our wins. No. Did anybody miss what do we call it? Assembly. The assembly. If you missed it, I recommend it. I laugh. Because what assembly reminds me of is when I was in a young child in grade school, they'd have this big stack of carpet. They were like squares of carpet. And you go into the gym and you'd pull off a square of carpet, and all the children would sit on a square of carpet. And that was like you'd have an assembly. I remember that too. Put everyone in the gym or like convert the half cafeteria gym, take away the big barrier between it so that we can have more room. And then take those carpets that have never been cleaned and just sit on them and it'll be great. Aside from the goofy name, I thought that and of course we can't talk about any of it on YouTube. But, man, that was, like, a really awesome look back at, like, here's some wins and here's some exciting things that we've done. And so I think we just need to get better at this as a company. I think this exercise is an opportunity of that. I think we do a little bit of that, but this is doing it more. Samia, you have some questions here for Alita? Yes. So in the competitive mean, I've already identified the features for CD Configure, as well as Monitor getting it reviewed from PM. My guess was, or my understanding was that we wouldn't have the same set of competitors that we're going to compare to, but the right competitors for that particular stage. Right. So, for example, for Monitor, we may not have, like, a GitHub or something like that. We would have Monitor based competitors. That the understanding, because we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage. I thought we were going to be using those competitors to compare against. So I just wanted your input on what because I saw some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there. They may not be relevant. For example, Cloudbee may not be relevant for Monitor state at all. So that's what I wanted to check with you. Yeah, that's the case. I need to go back and look at the spreadsheet. I mean, if the competitor does not apply to that particular stage, they shouldn't be on that tab in the spreadsheet. So are you saying that you see competitors on that tab for a stage where they don't apply? Yeah, I think it was copy pasted. Each one of them has the same. So each sheet has Ado, Atlassian, GitHub, Jenkins, JFrog, and Cloud. Right. That may not be relevant for Monitor. For Configure, it would be a different set of competitors that we need to include, which I think we already identified a while back. I think we identified top three competitors for every stage. Yeah, that's when we tiered them. Right. Tier one, tier two, tier three. So where we are right now is we're looking at just tier one competitors. That's probably why I cut and pasted them, because those are all tier ones. We're just focusing on tier one right now. So if they don't apply to that stage, don't worry about it. Makes sense. So just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage. Right. We just use the tier one competitors, and if they are not applicable, then we don't have to fill out anything. For them for now. But then we'll move to tier two and tier three. Then we'll look at those other competitors. Do we need to add a line item for GitLab as well? Because I think that's the same over here. Yeah, we should add a I think you asked me that before, right? Or someone asked me. I'm just looking at it? Brian asked because the way without it, you're basically putting all the things that we're better at. Yeah, for sure. Right. Ideally, when we pick, like, the ten to 15 features, some of those were like GitLab only. Some of those were like, GitLab didn't. Have well, I thought it was supposed to be none of them should be GitLab only. Right. It should be all through the lens of exactly. Yeah. It should be like, market lens. So in an ideal world, most of them are like, this is what I'm shopping for, this solution. Some of them might be GitLab only, some of them might be like, competitor only, so that somebody would look at it and be like, this looks honest and trustworthy and like, an accurate assessment of the then. Yeah, I think, Samia, for this, just to kind of reiterate for this one, we're only doing these five competitors, so we'll do the other ones in a later stage. And then if the vendor bills themselves as a platform, then we should specifically call out that they have zero. So GitHub builds itself as a platform. It sells itself that way. Same with azure. DevOps Same with JFrog. Well, they all do for tier one, except Jenkins and CloudBees. Yeah, Jenkins. Cloudbase does not. But what is know? Azure DevOps GitHub atlassian. And although Atlassians, we still need to figure something out there. As a matter of fact, did I go back and add Atlassian? Because based on conversation, I think we have to do it. I don't think we can leave them. All I have to look at this. Is Atlassian is on that sheet. Okay. Yeah, I went back and added them because based on discussion, I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner. But we can't do. For for those platform, we should call out the fact that they don't have any monitoring. If they have, like, zero out of 15, we should call that out. Same with configure stuff or any those kind of capabilities. I think if we took that a step further, it'd be good to even describe it in a way that doesn't just say our product stage and use, like, a value based description of what monitor and configure mean, because otherwise that's not going to do any good for us. Have you guys seen the new infographic that the design team has come up with? Not yet. Oh, you haven't? No. Do we have a link to that quickly, William? I don't know. Or you can throw it in the throw it in the notes if you find it. Let's see who can find it faster. Not with the amount of tabs I have open. Oh, my God. That's why I'm like it probably won't be me. So this is why I send everything to a Google Gmail, because the search is so fast. So I literally have a folder where all of my GitLab pings go, and I can just search for infographic. I found it. Who could look at first? I found it. There's two. This is the one for the single tool comparison, but it's going to look the same. But then here's the one for I just put it in chat for you guys. And here's the one for the platform players. We made a couple of decisions along the way. One of the decisions was to just go with stages. It would have been like a whole nother layer of, okay, if we don't go with just the GitLab stages, the ten stages, what do we use? That has to be determined, reconciled, all this kind of stuff. I don't know how long it's been since we updated. Those pages have not been updated, but we kind of are just trying to move towards some progress. So I concur that maybe configure and monitor is not as descriptive as it could be, but the place where it will. So actually, I'll share one thing. It just seems like the right time to do this. Right. Manage is even less descriptive than that. The way this is getting built is off of a data model. So in theory, these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same. Right. We're separating presentation layer from data layer. So it's not going to be as hard to update in the future as it currently is, where it's a mess of spaghetti code and it's really difficult to update. And then the other component is then not in this iteration, we need to get something live. But in the next iteration, you'll click on Verify and it'll go down to the list of the 15 features. And that's where you can describe what the heck of Verify is or what the heck of manage. Okay, so we will have an opportunity because I was about to say, you're going to hate me for this, but we're being cyclical about the same problem we had, which being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages. That was one of the big things. It's like, okay, 15 features. What are they? Why do I care to say? That means nothing to me looking at this page. But quick question, I'm not going to. Be a Debbie Downer. That's it? No, we're on top of it, actually. If you read the thread, I brought that up, but she said we can't do it right now. Which I understand, but small thing, what do you guys think about the colors? I don't know. I usually let the designers handle that stuff. I like the fact that there's no red on there. Oh, you like that? That's what I was going for. You like that? Okay. It's not obviously negative because it really does lend itself to being a comparison more than a competitive piece because of that. Because these folks at 37% are in the red and they're terrible. They just have less green or we would have less green. So it's not being worse, it's being less good. I think that lends itself to working with all the cooperation situations we were talking about. Yeah, that's the goal. We want to generate a helpful asset for the industry. This is not just like, marketing shill. This should be like, a helpful page. The goal is to have a comparison comparing DevOps tools, not a this is all of our competitors and why we're better. Yeah. I think from a competitive mindset. And for me, I'm like, let's go hard. Let's put some red on there and call them. That's just the way I think. Right. But I brought it up, and for now, we're going to stick with the green. They recommend it. We stick with the green and see how it goes. But I don't know. I was feeling the red and yellow, too. It is easy on the eyes. There's something to be said for that. Cool. Well, we're almost up on time, but I did want to share one thing that kind of came in, like, basically Friday. It was like, late Thursday for me. So this is another thing. A lot of these things I don't have a ton of context on. I just know we're just trying to up our game. So, like, hey, let's move fast and do the best we can do. So this is a little bit of a messaging framework. And then the assignment that was given to me was to fill in these boxes here. And then this was the Fodder that I got. So there was these ones that said, like, from roadmap to company vision, we are transparent and a single source of truth. Countless possibilities. Honestly, I think this one's really pithy and catchy. I really like it. I really liked. What's the other one that I like that not everyone does? All in one for everyone. So I don't know. I just think so. There's something catchy about that, but I know that kind of catchy is not everyone's cup of tea. All that to say is the assignment here that I took, it was to write a pithy few words, like punchy statement for each of these three things. So I ended up with a single source of truth, countless possibilities. I like that a lot. This one, I went with end to end control over your software factory. Not as pithy, not as catchy, but. I think that what's the difference between that slide and the next one that doesn't have anything under security? Honestly, when I first got this, it didn't have this and it didn't have anything under security. All I do is just your iteration of it. Yeah, this is mine. This is I just put here so that I would have the original statements. Got it. Automate nearly anything, collaborate on everything. I kind of like that. But this one I hate. Scale up, speed up, test up. I don't think anybody tests up. I think that's really goofy. So hate it. That's what I love for me. I love it. Or I hate it. Right? I love how you're just like bam. So anyway, what I'd love in just in 5 minutes now and then we can kind of end the call is kind of like anything that you would change this out for, anything that you would change this out for. And then actually, let's start here. This one I couldn't pick and I'll tell you why. It's because I like things to have parity in their tone. Right? So this is maybe like super nuanced elements of messaging. But I hate it if it's like a single source of truth. That's like in noun phrase end to end control. That's like a noun item. So you could say with GitLab you get a single source of truth. With GitLab you get end to end control. And you can't say with GitLab you get move fast with confidence. No, but you can say more speed, less risk. I like that one the best. I don't like the last one. Agreed. That's why I put this one at Top was for that parody and then so it sounds like kind of you all's thoughts are that's good as well. Yeah, the only thing it might be missing but I don't know how we do it without overcomplicating. It is well, I guess less risk also implies higher quality. I guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together. So I've talked myself out of not liking that. So yeah, good. Cindy's last blog post had a really good turn of phrase that I stole for GitLab 14 while she was out. It was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that you're making in it. She said it really elegantly and it's deliverables. Secure the Software factory and its deliverables. Yeah, and I thought it was good to emphasize both because they mean different things. It's nice. Yeah. So you could say secure and control your software factory and its deliverables. Maybe that would encompass both thoughts. I'm not a big fan of its deliverables. Can we say like your software factory. And your software or your product? Product sounds like car manufacturer. You can say IP here, but it just doesn't sound right and it's always shorthand. Yeah, I like this one better. Yeah, I think I do, too. But I appreciate the Brian. And then the last thing I'll say is so this was my attempt to channel my inner Ash withers I think Ash is super good at just again, just the catchier, like the turn of phrase element to it. And so this kind of idea, like single source of truth, countless possibilities, or all in one for everyone. There's something catchy about this. So here I was trying to envision what is it that we actually give you with this velocity? It's velocity with confidence is what you get. I like your move fast with confidence. Better than increase speed and stay on track. Yeah. I was thinking of, like, if you're in a race car and you go super fast, let's say you're in the bike race, right, and you're going so fast and somebody holds out the sign, and then, like, half of the bike race collapses, right? So it's almost kind of like you can keep going faster and faster and faster. And if somebody jumps out with a sign in the middle of a racetrack, you're not going to get tripped up by it because GitLabs, its testing is going to catch that, its security is going to catch that. All of those elements that allow you to move faster, but to do so with confidence, because otherwise the faster you go, then it gets more dangerous. So trying to encapsulate that, that was kind of where I was like, stay on track, but I didn't like it either. Did you just open the door for a NASCAR partnership? Hey, NASCAR goes fast and turns left because it get loud. You're our new Ricky Bob audience demographic. I don't think I like that one. And then I think between these two, I like, move fast with confidence, but I don't like the verbiage of it because it doesn't have parity. So that's where I think more speed. Do you want to add maybe we can add high confidence or more confidence at the end of your first statement. So it kind of combines all of it. So more speed, less risk. High confidence. I was going to say confidence is kind of overused anyway. Like, I'd see a lot of competitors and vendors using it. I really like the first one. Just more speed, less risk. Bam. No trade offs is how it is. No trade offs. That's one of my go to. I love that one. This gets into the no trade offs. The engineer in me says there's never no trade offs. That's like saying, like, 100% secure. This is why we always say mitigate, right? We always say risk or less risk. You never say no way with messaging, right? I mean, not everything. How about just more speed, less risk with confidence? Yeah, more speed. The Ricky Bobby and me really did like the no trade offs, though. Parker yeah. Oh, is that was that from no. But it could have been. It's something Ricky Bobby would have said. If anyone hasn't seen Talladega Nights, they should. That's the homework for this weekend. Watch Talladega Nights and come back and we talk about it on Monday in our little social port. I often say, thank you, little eight pound, five ounce baby Jesus with the golden diapers. I say that so often that I just think everybody has seen Talladega Nights. But then I realized that people that haven't are like, William's really weird. And then next week we'll watch Step Brothers. That's another great one. So much room for activities. Okay, I'm going to go with more speed, less risk, and I think this is due at the end of the day, so any additional thoughts? I'm actually going to untag, man. Strong. All those are cool. Those are good. Awesome. Well, this was kind of fun to do. A little bit of working together session and razzle dazzle. Keep it rocking.

        "transcript_text": "You. There you go. Already an incremental improvement from last week. Excellent. All right, so let me just jump on three then. I think right now we have a set of guidelines that are feeling much more consistent. But I think if we throw these guidelines to people, might be essentially throwing them over the wall to them. I'm just wondering if we should have a quick intro to the guidelines on the landing page saying that perhaps highlighting the ones that are most important or the ones that mean more of a change. Or perhaps highlighting from the goals that we wanted to achieve from this project, highlighting how we can do this. So, for instance, to provide exit level overview, make sure that you create an epic, that you set the dates on the epics and that you set the weight on the issues. And then perhaps if we want to focus on consistency, then we can mention that. Make sure that you organize these prints following this or these iterations following these guidelines. Make sure that all of your issues are assigned to a particular sprint and so on. Essentially, say, a quick level overview on how to start working with the guidelines so they're easier to digest, essentially, and people can see the bigger picture rather than going straight into each individual guidelines. Yeah, I support, like, when it comes to enablement like this, I'm like perfectionist, but right now I'm like, you need to just go with the MVC. Let's give it over to them. But I think the intro would be really helpful to them and we'll see everyone will adopt it, I think, slowly. But the intent is that the intent first is for the captains to take a look and give some feedback. Or are we just saying, everyone start using it? Should we change? I would say feedback, perhaps, because, as you say, it might be difficult for them, for all of the teams to adopt straight away. And then we might identify things that are more important to them before they have to implement it and do some changes further down the road. Yeah, let's carry on with that. Same structure, just a little bit different timeline. I can take an action on that one. Something I might be able to work on tomorrow, but I wouldn't make this high level overview a blocker. Essentially, I feel that it's something that we need, but I wouldn't want to delay any other activities. Sorry I was late. I take a break. I haven't had a break since this morning. But did we decide on the milestones? Did you already cover that, like, two weeks or so? Yeah, we skipped it so that you can join the conversation as well. But I'm advocating for going to two week simply because there's three teams who have adopted well, not three things. Sorry. There's five teams now, so MPM, Strategic Marketing and Marketing are in two weeks. And then it was growth and Corporate marketing were in one week, and I'm thinking that it might be easier to go from one week to two weeks rather than the other way around. To me, at the end of the day, let's pick something I'm in for consistency. And that's what I've added the comment on the Mr as well along those lines. But yeah, I'm happy to subject it to a vote, as you were proposing, Jackie as well. And last week, Gabe suggested that we use two week milestones, but then use iterations for smaller chunks of time and do one week iterations if the team wanted to be on one week sprints. Which kind of makes sense. We got into a discussion about what the reporting would look like because that's kind of a hack as well. But I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I think it's most important that we all just start doing something. My team isn't using two weeks, but I put it in there because I have some people doing it. I think the key distinction is if you're doing a bigger project and you're managing it yourself, two weeks does seem better suited for that when you're doing quick turnarounds. The team members of mine that were not in the milestone piece, they're the ones doing the quick turnaround and then the one doing the big projects. We're using the milestones. I think it depends on your case. So I understand wanting the iterations inside of a milestone just as something they could use. We'll see what that looks like because that kind of flips everything that growth has been doing on their head. But Danielle also mentioned if it's up to consistency, then she'd rather build to the consistency and retrain the team. I think we just need to make a decision. Let's do that then. In that case, let's go with that. I'll merge the DMR but one thing that I've mentioned as well to Dara is she was advocating for using user stories for scheduling on iterations. And I prefer to keep that outside of the iterations discussion because not everyone will be using Agile. And then I think Agile implementing Agile was outside the scope of this project. I think it's fine to recommend how to use user stories, perhaps on the Issues guidelines, but everything should be able to use Issues as task or user stories. I think user stories are great for a team that's service oriented. I really don't think and I don't think we throw away that idea with one week sprints, but for teams that it works for, keep it in all of the all of the issue templates. Okay. Cool. Update the whole iterations versus milestones piece right now. Sorry, which update under? Well, for her Mr, under guidelines, like we still say, define milestone at lowest level needed. But that seems in contrast, is there a different Mr to be looking at? And that the naming convention is still showing like two letter abbreviation followed by underscore but aren't we moving to the. Overall yeah, good point. Higher level, or am I getting. Yeah, I think we might want to remove that initial content that we had. So that it's. Thanks. Right. Am I misunderstanding? This would be accurate now, right? This is a leftover from the initial guidelines that we have. We can perhaps remove this now on a separate Mr. Separate Mr. Okay. Yeah. Let me just add a note. So for this Mr, I'll reach out to Dara to comment on my suggestion, not to mention using user stories. And then once she's done that, then I'll go ahead and merge with the advocating for two week sprints. It's all that I have myself. Is there anything else you wanted to discuss today. As a next step? I'm commenting into the captains. There's still some teams that haven't had a volunteer, so I'll follow up to make sure that we have someone represented from all the teams. Cormac, will you be the product marketing? Should you be for all of strategic, or what do you think? Did technical marketing, customer insight, intelligence need to be represented? I feel like we should probably have at least one other person from SM who's not in PMM, whether that's TMM or AR. Maybe AR, because they're probably the most different from us, and they have the most contact with external folks as well. Yeah, and we've been working through a lot of processes lately. Me and Joyce and Brian. I'll tag both. You don't nobody from dance team should be should I tag him just to. See if he wants yeah, tag him. But especially with tie out, they're stretched pretty thin, and they work pretty close with PMM, whereas Arr is on a completely different they use different tools. Matter of fact, most of what AR spends their time in is email because they're dealing with analysts who live in it. So that would be an interesting perspective. All right, Jackie, is there anything that we can do at least once on this call to help with team captains? It looks like I only have I'm assuming that Becky will probably set up for Brandon Digital since she's been so involved in the. So perhaps, or if not, then Shane. I don't know. Start on there and see if he wants to have somebody represent them. But it might be that Becky, since she's kind of project managing for them and with them, he might be able to speak to what she thinks will be challenges. But I'll ask Shane Luchard to represent someone. Hi, Gabe. Started to hop in for a couple of minutes. Thanks for joining. That you're here. I didn't check this, so perhaps it hasn't happened. Have you had the chance to talk to the development teams about enabling the feature flag for the marketing group for iterations? Yeah, it's broken right now, so there's no point. Okay. As soon as I can verify that it works in minimal fashion, I'll make sure that happens. Okay, cool. There's no particular urgency right now as we decided to go with milestones in the meantime, but yeah, just let us know if there's anything that we can do on our side as well. Yeah. Other than that, I think we were pretty much done with the call today. Or is there any other topic we'd want to discuss? Can we get Confidential Epics enabled for marketing? Yeah, so for that and other things too, just as a future thing, if you go into the S underscore plan channel and just say, hey, can you please enable the feature flag for this thing? Some engineer will pick it up and do that for you. Because I can't do it. And that's all that I do is I ask in that channel, I say, hey, can we turn this on for this specific group? So just drop a link to which group you want it enabled, and an engineer will enable that feature flag. You set it for all of marketing so that we consistently have the same did you say that Strategic marketing has it right now? I don't know if anyone does. It would be in analyst relations because I know all of their issues are confidential, but I don't know about. Have I've been so tied at the hip with Joyce and Ryan? We can't do it, and we want to do it for analyst. Do you what do you say? Turn on the flag. Enable yeah, enable the feature flag for this group, please, and just, like, drop a link, like, whatever feature flag it is, just say for the you don't need another name. Just say for the confidential Epics feature flag. It. Next up, I'll finalized. Captains, we can push. So, David, you're putting an intro to the project management. Don't block on this. It's something that I'll probably be adding at least the first incarnation this week. But let's not block on should I? Once we have everyone, I'm going to open an issue for them to review, and I'll put a checkbox for each of the project management pages that we've created and say, like, Review y z. And then I'll have some mechanism for them to take notes on feedback, and then we'll do some sessions on it. With the holiday next week and a lot of people out on vacation, it might be kind of difficult, but at least we can capture it async, yeah, that makes sense. I think at least having them their eyes on those pages will be a good start. Great. All right. Anything else? So that I had myself, too. All right, thanks a lot, Kate, for adding the link on the notes. Yeah, that's the name of the feature flag and all that good stuff. We're starting to try to do a better job when things are behind the feature flag, to put that in the documentation so that anybody can find out about it and do the same thing for iterations, I'm going to drop because I think there's a really bad storm that's about to hit. I was looking at the wind in the back there. You had some trees that were going kind of crazy. Oh, yeah. I'm right on the edge of the mountain, so we get, like, the crazy wind when the bad storms come. Well, good luck. Thanks. Sure. Cheers. Jackie, do you want to go to that channel, whichever that one is, to ask for enabling that feature flock I already wrote up. I'm looking for just to have the group link for them. I'm going to for marketing, not GitLab.com, although, I guess yeah, good point. Because if we're defining the Epics, I'll do it for marketing only because otherwise it might be a bit of a surprise for everyone who's under GitLab.com. Yeah, I'm going to just say for marketing right now because our Epics are within the Marketing Epic section, like Cross Functional Marketing Ops, and some other teams might be using it higher, like website. And they can request that flag, I guess. Yeah, good point. All right, I'm putting that in, and I'll tag you too, on it. Cool. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Thanks, everyone. Good morning, everybody. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

        "transcript_text": "Hello, viewers, and welcome to our team video for field marketing. I am Steph Sarf. I am a recruiter here at GitLab, and I support hiring for our fabulous field marketing team. I'm based in Portland, Oregon, and I'll be moderating A-Q-A to get to know this team a bit more. So let's start off with some introductions. Leslie, do you want to kick us off? Thanks, Steph. So I am Leslie Blanchard. I am based in beautiful Raleigh, North Carolina, and I'm excited that the sun is shining today and I am responsible for worldwide field marketing. Thanks, Leslie. Hi, I'm Ken Grubowski. I am based in upstate South Carolina on Lake Hartwell in the foothills of the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains, not too far from Clemson University. Go Tigers. And I lead the field marketing team for the Americas. Thanks, Ken. I'm Peter Quinn. I'm based in Sydney, Australia, down under, and I manage field marketing for Asia Pacific region. Hi, I'm Ginny. I am based out of Long Island, New York, if you can't hear the accent. And I am the senior field marketing manager supporting the east and Latin America sales teams. Perfect. I am excited to connect with everyone today and get your answers to some of these questions. So at a high level, just to kick us off, Leslie, tell me a little bit about what it is that your team does. Yeah, so our field marketing team is really charged with helping to build the sales pipeline for both our large and our mid market sales team. So we work really closely with sellers in both segments as well as their solution architects and our sales development reps. So we'll do anything from sponsoring third party events both in person and of course, virtual. As we're filming this, we're in the middle of the COVID pandemic, so everything we've done from a field marketing standpoint in person has flipped to virtual. And really we target the different personas that GitLab sells into. So we also have sales acceleration plays, which are hands on workshops. We'll run things like regional intelligence surveys where we can really help our sales teams gather intelligence on what accounts we think might have a higher propensity to buy from GitLab. We've also recently started running what GitLab calls account centric micro campaigns. So this is where we really go in and hyper focus on a list of mutually agreed upon accounts between our sellers and field marketing. And we're driving these accounts to virtually engage with us. And that's been really fun and exciting to see our field marketers and our sales teams and SDRs work really closely together on that campaign. So I would say if you're watching this video, then I really strongly encourage you to check out our field marketing handbook page. There's a ton of awesome information, so if you're liking what you hear in this video, check out our web page sorry, our handbook page, where we've got a whole bunch of more information and you can really get into the details of understanding how we work in Field Marketing before actually talking to any of us. Love it. I can link that in the video too, so you'll be able to see that as we're talking about this. But I guess the next question to get into is just why did you personally choose to join GitLab? And so, Pete, I'd love to start with you. Thanks. Yeah. So I joined GitLab because of the growth it was experiencing and the uniqueness of the company. I really believed in the product vision and the benefits of a single application, and being the first Field Marketing high in the region was a really exciting prospect for me. I wanted to contribute to the success of GitLab, and I just want to be part of something special. Love it. Yeah. That's awesome, Pete. I could listen to Pete all day long. So I had a unique experience with how I joined GitLab. So originally, GitLab was recommended to me by previous colleagues, and it became highly recommended. And oddly enough, what happened was I was introduced to Leslie when there really was no role, and we just started chatting about Field Marketing about a year before I ever joined. And we stayed connected, and she came and she met me in New York when she was in, and we had another conversation, and it started to sound like the place that I wanted to be. But what ultimately sold me on GitLab was, as I was interviewing with GitLab, I was also interviewing with other companies. And although the other companies were beautiful, great companies, I was starting to hear my career sort of lay flat. I wasn't getting excited, and that was extremely different during my interviews with GitLab. So I started to have, like, an emotional response to how Field Marketing could once again be exciting for me and enhance my experience in a role that I had been doing for about ten years. And that's how I ended up cool. Jenny. I had a very similar experience. I was seeking a role with a progressive, forward thinking, and fast growing company that really mirrored my values. I've worked for several companies over the course of my career that really preach work, life balance, collaboration, transparency. And during the interview process, like Jenny, I grew more and more excited about GitLab as it became clear to me GitLab truly lives and works by these values and strongly encourages all team members to live and work by them as well. From my very first conversation with Steph, which was totally awesome, to my final interview with Leslie, which was equally as totally awesome, I knew GitLab was where I needed to be. I love it. All that warms my heart. So someone say, if someone's interested in a role on this team, what would you want them to know? Leslie, I'd love to start with you. Yeah. So we'll say we do things a little bit differently here at GitLab. Before I joined GitLab, I had no idea what writing in markdown was. I write in markdown on a daily basis, and we use our product day in and day out to manage our work. We use GitLab issues where we're writing and markdown. There's a preview button so you can check your markdown before you hit submit. We've got these issue templates at Field Marketing. Our field marketers are in, and they're planning their work, they're tracking their work, they're collaborating with other folks within the organization. Write in these issues. I don't even use my email. It's only when I'm interacting with other vendors, outside vendors. Otherwise I'm always in GitLab. We also work in salesforce.com, and in our ROI tool called Science, we're building out some super cool dashboards there. And also our Field Marketing team has recently taken on building marketo and salesforce.com campaigns. So if you are into working with sales to help them build pipeline while also kind of being your own CMO of your region in terms of building operationally, setting up your campaigns, then I would say GitLab is the place for you. How about you, Jenny? What do you think? I love that, Leslie, because it's so interesting that we work inside of our product, right. I had no experience with issues. Even the word was foreign to me. And so it was a lot of fun getting to see my transition throughout that whole process. So I think what I would tell somebody and what I have, because I've recommended people here before and they are happily working here now, is that they have to get used to, which is an environment of trust. So we have this workplace where we can go in and we can suggest things and we can use our creativity, and everything is welcome. So there's really nothing crazy that we could come up with. It's always a discussion. We partner great with our team members, our greater global team members. It's an unusual environment because you're not so used to, I think, from coming from much larger organizations, you're not used to feeling like that. You're not feeling that support is a constant here. So you're never really alone in what you're doing. And I think that that's really where I start, because most people have challenges where they are, and I want them to feel like when they come here, they're not going to be left alone. Love it all. And so to get into the next one would love to hear and I feel like we've kind of been going into this, but just how GitLab is different than other places that you have personally worked. Pete, do you want to kick that one off? Yeah, sure. So GitLab is like no other place I've worked before. It's made up of extremely talented, passionate, and motivated people who live our values every day. There's a strong sense of team culture, and that sounds funny because we don't physically sit next to a colleague. I remember my first week, I slacked a question to my manager Leslie, and it was in the middle of the night for her. I had a response from somebody in Europe in a totally different team. Respond to me and help me. So there was a real sense of support. And what I like to say is that I sometimes feel alone. But we're alone together. And at GitLab we really are all living it together. Yeah, we really are. It comes out of the GitLab culture. So culture and values are words that are being thrown around a lot, especially when you're interviewing with companies. Those words are the draw to why you would want to work for a company. Unfortunately for most companies out there, they fall short once you actually join the company. They forget what those values and cultures were that they were promising during the interview process. GitLab is so the extreme opposite to that. They are so true to their culture, to the employees, to the customers. Really. Anyone who interacts with us gets to experience what that true culture and values really is. And for me, and I guess for most remote employees, it's so important that you feel like you're part of a bigger picture, that you're actually making a difference for the company that you work for. And that's not always easy remotely, right? But GitLab knows no other way, so that's what we do. So they are fantastic at bringing together teams from people from all over the world who collaborate, work and create great things together. So global is much smaller place here at GitLab. Yep, so true. Last question. I would just love to hear when we are hiring for a role, because I imagine that a lot of people watching this video are interested in potentially working at GitLab. So hello to you. But when hiring for a role, what is important to you? Ken, I'd love to hear your response to this. Wow. Steph, great question. Because building upon what Jenny just said, and I mean, Jenny, you just, you nailed it. Definitely. For me, values is at the top of the list. It's why I joined this company and it's what I look for in potential members of the team. Teamwork and collaboration are paramount to any team being successful. And it's important to me that folks on my team truly enjoy working together and are willing and excited to help each other be successful. A lack of experience in a specific area isn't always an obstacle if someone's willing to learn and open to being mentored. As long as it's a good fit for a team, it's a recipe for success. That's why when I'm interviewing candidates for my team, I always include everyone in the process. And by everyone, I don't mean just potential coworkers on our team, but their potential peers in other parts of the organization. They might be collaborating with or working on a special project with, and most definitely their key stakeholders in the region or segment they support. But it's really all about values and fit and definitely Pace and I could go on with that forever. But everyone is extremely passionate on our team and truly love working together. That makes the day go by so fast and so quickly. Yeah. And I'll second what Ken said and know Pete and Jenny as well on the values front and the team front.
